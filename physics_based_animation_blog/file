 Stable, Circulation-Preserving Simplicial Fluids  ##   “Visual quality, low computational cost, and numerical stability are foremost goals in computer animation. An important ingredient in achieving these goals is the conservation of fundamental motion invariants. For example, rigid and deformable body simulation benefits greatly from the conservation of linear and angular momenta. In the case of fluids, however, none of the current techniques focuses on conserving invariants, and consequently, often introduce a visually disturbing numerical diffusion of vorticity. Just as important visually is the resolution of complex simulation domains. Doing so with regular (even if adaptive) grid techniques can be computationally delicate. In this article, we propose a novel technique for the simulation of fluid flows. It is designed to respect the defining differential properties, that is, the conservation of circulation along arbitrary loops as they are transported by the flow. Consequently, our method offers several new and desirable properties: Arbitrary simplicial meshes (triangles in 2D, tetrahedra in 3D) can be used to define the fluid domain; the computations involved in the update procedure are efficient due to discrete operators with small support; and it preserves discrete circulation, avoiding numerical diffusion of vorticity.” Stable, Circulation-Preserving Simplicial Fluids  Stable, Circulation-Preserving Simplicial Fluids http://www.geometry.caltech.edu/pubs.html   ## March 25th, 2007  ##  Fluids   ##  http://www.physicsbasedanimation.com/2007/03/25/stable-circulation-preserving-simplicial-fluids/

 Discrete Quadratic Bending Energies  ##   “We present a family of discrete isometric bending models (IBMs) for triangulated surfaces in 3-space. These models are derived from an axiomatic treatment of discrete Laplace operators, using these operators to obtain linear models for discrete mean curvature from which bending energies are assembled. Under the assumption of isometric surface deformations we show that these energies are quadratic in surface positions. The corresponding linear energy gradients and constant energy Hessians constitute an efficient model for computing bending forces and their derivatives, enabling fast time-integration of cloth dynamics with a two- to three-fold net speedup over existing nonlinear methods, and near-interactive rates for Willmore smoothing of large meshes.” Discrete Quadratic Bending Energies Admittedly a bit of a stretch as a physics paper, but a primary application of the energies they describe is in accelerating the calculation of bending forces for cloth simulation.

 Advections with Significantly Reduced Dissipation and Diffusion  ##   “Back and forth error compensation and correction (BFECC) was recently developed for interface computation using a level set method. We show that BFECC can be applied to reduce dissipation and diffusion encountered in a variety of advection steps, such as velocity, smoke density, and image advections on uniform and adaptive grids and on a triangulated surface. BFECC can be implemented trivially as a small modification of the first-order upwind or semi-Lagrangian integration of advection equations. It provides second-order accuracy in both space and time. When applied to level set evolution, BFECC reduces volume loss significantly. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach on image advection and on the simulation of smoke, bubbles in water, and the highly dynamic interaction between water, a solid, and air. We also apply BFECC to dye advection to visualize vector fields.” Advections with Significantly Reduced Dissipation and Diffusion  Advections with Significantly Reduced Dissipation and Diffusion http://www.gvu.gatech.edu/~jarek/papers/Advect.pdf   ## April 2nd, 2007  ##  Fluids   ##  http://www.physicsbasedanimation.com/2007/04/02/advections-with-significantly-reduced-dissipation-and-diffusion/

Because of the difficult, often unsolved problems that arise in alt these areas, a broad diversity of approaches is used, each with strengths that make it appropriate for particular applications.

 Fracturing Rigid Materials  ##    “We propose a novel approach to fracturing (and denting) brittle materials. To avoid the computational burden imposed by the stringent time step restrictions of explicit methods or with solving nonlinear systems of equations for implicit methods, we treat the material as a fully rigid body in the limit of infinite stiffness. In addition to a triangulated surface mesh and level set volume for collisions, each rigid body is outfitted with a tetrahedral mesh upon which finite element analysis can be carried out to provide a stress map for fracture criteria. We demonstrate that the commonly used stress criteria can lead to arbitrary fracture (especially for stiff materials) and instead propose the notion of a time averaged stress directly into the FEM analysis. When objects fracture, the virtual node algorithm provides new triangle and tetrahedral meshes in a straightforward and robust fashion. Although each new rigid body can be rasterized to obtain a new level set, small shards can be difficult to accurately resolve. Therefore, we propose a novel collision handling technique for treating both rigid bodies and rigid body thin shells represented by only a triangle mesh.” Fracturing Rigid Materials  Fracturing Rigid Materials http://graphics.stanford.edu/~fedkiw/   ## April 2nd, 2007  ##  Fracture   ##  http://www.physicsbasedanimation.com/2007/04/02/fracturing-rigid-materials/  
 Fast Animation of Lightning Using an Adaptive Mesh  ##    “We present a fast method for simulating, animating, and rendering lightning using adaptive grids. The “dielectric breakdown model” is an elegant algorithm for electrical pattern formation that we extend to enable animation of lightning. The simulation can be slow, particularly in 3D, because it involves solving a large Poisson problem. Losasso et al. recently proposed an octree data structure for simulating water and smoke, and we show that this discretization can be applied to the problem of lightning simulation as well. However, implementing the incomplete Cholesky conjugate gradient (ICCG) solver for this problem can be daunting, so we provide an extensive discussion of implementation issues. ICCG solvers can usually be accelerated using “Eisenstat’s trick,” but the trick cannot be directly applied to the adaptive case. Fortunately, we show that an “almost incomplete Cholesky” factorization can be computed so that Eisenstat’s trick can still be used. We then present a fast rendering method based on convolution that is competitive with Monte Carlo ray tracing but orders of magnitude faster, and we also show how to further improve the visual results using jittering.”                                                                                               Fast Animation of Lightning Using an Adaptive Mesh                                                                                                Fast Animation of Lightning Using an Adaptive Mesh http://www.cs.unc.edu/~kim/publications.html   ## April 2nd, 2007  ##  Uncategorized   ##  http://www.physicsbasedanimation.com/2007/04/02/fast-animation-of-lightning-using-an-adaptive-mesh/

 Simulation of Bubbles in Foam with the Volume Control Method  ##   “Liquid and gas interactions often contain bubbles that stay for a long time without bursting on the surface, making a dry foam structure. Such long lasting bubbles simulated by the level set method can suffer from a slow but steady volume error that accumulates to a visible amount of volume change. We propose to address this problem by using the volume control method. We trace the volume change of each connected region, and apply a carefully computed divergence that compensates undesired volume changes. To compute the divergence, we construct a mathematical model of the volume change, choose control strategies that regulate the modeled volume error, and establish methods to compute the control gains that provide robust and fast reduction of the volume error, and (if desired) the control of how the volume changes over time.” Simulation of Bubbles in Foam with the Volume Control Method  Simulation of Bubbles in Foam with the Volume Control Method http://www.gvu.gatech.edu/%7Ejarek/papers.html   ## April 11th, 2007  ##  Fluids   ##  http://www.physicsbasedanimation.com/2007/04/11/simulation-of-bubbles-in-foam-with-the-volume-control-method/  
 Curl-Noise for Procedural Fluid Flow  ##   “Procedural methods for animating turbulent fluid are often preferred over simulation, both for speed and for the degree of animator control. We offer an extremely simple approach to efficiently generating turbulent velocity fields based on Perlin noise, with a formula that is exactly incompressible (necessary for the characteristic look of everyday fluids), exactly respects solid boundaries (not allowing fluid to flow through arbitrarily-specified surfaces), and whose amplitude can be modulated in space as desired. In addition, we demonstrate how to combine this with procedural primitives for flow around moving rigid objects, vortices, etc.”  Curl-Noise for Procedural Fluid Flow   Curl-Noise for Procedural Fluid Flow http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~rbridson/   ## May 2nd, 2007  ##  Fluids   ##  http://www.physicsbasedanimation.com/2007/05/02/curl-noise-for-procedural-fluid-flow/  
 A Variational Approach to Eulerian Geometry Processing  ##   “We present a purely Eulerian framework for geometry processing of surfaces and foliations. Contrary to current Eulerian methods used in graphics, we use conservative methods and a variational interpretation, offering a unified framework for routine surface operations such as smoothing, offsetting, and animation. Computations are performed on a fixed volumetric grid without recourse to Lagrangian techniques such as triangle meshes, particles, or path tracing. At the core of our approach is the use of the Coarea Formula to express area integrals over isosurfaces as volume integrals. This enables the simultaneous processing of multiple isosurfaces, while a single interface can be treated as the special case of a dense foliation. We show that our method is a powerful alternative to conventional geometric representations in delicate cases such as the handling of high-genus surfaces, weighted offsetting, foliation smoothing of medical datasets, and incompressible fluid animation.”  A Variational Approach to Eulerian Geometry Processing While ostensibly a geometry processing paper, it would appear to have applications to surface tracking for liquid animation, so I’m going include it.   A Variational Approach to Eulerian Geometry Processing http://www.geometry.caltech.edu/pubs.html   ## May 2nd, 2007  ##  Fluids   ##  http://www.physicsbasedanimation.com/2007/05/02/a-variational-approach-to-eulerian-geometry-processing/  
 A Fast Variational Framework for Accurate Solid-Fluid Coupling  ##   “Physical simulation has emerged as a compelling animation technique, yet current approaches to coupling simulations of fluids and solids with irregular boundary geometry are inefficient or cannot handle some relevant scenarios robustly. We propose a new variational approach which allows robust and accurate solution on relatively coarse Cartesian grids, allowing possibly orders of magnitude faster simulation. By rephrasing the classical pressure projection step as a kinetic energy minimization, broadly similar to modern approaches to rigid body contact, we permit a robust coupling between fluid and arbitrary solid simulations that always gives a well-posed symmetric positive semi-definite linear system. We provide several examples of efficient fluid-solid interaction and rigid body coupling with sub-grid cell flow. In addition, we extend the framework with a new boundary condition for free-surface flow, allowing fluid to separate naturally from solids.”  A Fast Variational Framework for Accurate Solid-Fluid Coupling  A Fast Variational Framework for Accurate Solid-Fluid Coupling http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~batty/variationalFluids/variationalFluids.html   ## May 3rd, 2007  ##  Fluids   ##  http://www.physicsbasedanimation.com/2007/05/03/a-fast-variational-framework-for-accurate-solid-fluid-coupling/  
 A Finite Element Method for Animating Large Viscoplastic Flow  ##   “We present an extension to Lagrangian finite element methods to allow for large plastic deformations of solid materials. These behaviors are seen in such everyday materials as shampoo, dough,  and clay as well as in fantastic gooey and blobby creatures in special effects scenes.  To account for plastic deformation, we explicitly update the linear basis functions defined over the finite elements during each simulation step.  When these updates cause the basis functions to become ill-conditioned, we remesh the simulation domain to produce a new high-quality finite-element mesh, taking care to preserve the original boundary.  We also introduce an enhanced plasticity model that preserves volume and includes creep and work hardening/softening.  We demonstrate our approach with simulations of synthetic objects that squish, dent, and flow. To validate our methods, we compare simulation results to videos of real materials.” A Finite Element Method for Animating Large Viscoplastic Flow  A Finite Element Method for Animating Large Viscoplastic Flow http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/projects/Bargteil-2007-AFE/   ## May 4th, 2007  ##  Deformables   ##  http://www.physicsbasedanimation.com/2007/05/04/a-finite-element-method-for-animating-large-viscoplastic-flow/  
 Isosurface Stuffing: Fast Tetrahedral Meshing with Good Dihedral Angles  ##    “The isosurface stuffing algorithm fills an isosurface with a uniformly sized tetrahedral mesh whose dihedral angles are bounded between 10.7◦ and 164.8◦, or (with a change in parameters) between 8.9◦ and 158.8◦. The algorithm is whip fast, numerically robust, and easy to implement because, like Marching Cubes, it generates tetrahedra from a small set of precomputed stencils. A variant of the algorithm creates a mesh with internal grading: on the boundary, where high resolution is generally desired, the elements are fine and uniformly sized, and in the interior they may be coarser and vary in size. This combination of features makes isosurface stuffing a powerful tool for dynamic fluid simulation, large-deformation mechanics, and applications that require interactive remeshing or use objects defined by smooth implicit surfaces. It is the first algorithm that rigorously guarantees the suitability of tetrahedra for finite element methods in domains whose shapes are substantially more challenging than boxes. Our angle bounds are guaranteed by a computer-assisted proof. If the isosurface is a smooth 2-manifold with bounded curvature, and the tetrahedra are sufficiently small, then the boundary of the mesh is guaranteed to be a geometrically and topologically accurate approximation of the isosurface.” Isosurface Stuffing: Fast Tetrahedral Meshing with Good Dihedral Angles Again, although this is a geometry paper at heart, it has obvious applications to fluids and finite element simulation, so it’s definitely relevant.

 Adaptively Sampled Particle Fluids  ##   “We present novel adaptive sampling algorithms for particle-based fluid simulation. We introduce a sampling condition based on geometric local feature size that allows focusing computational resources in geometrically complex regions, while reducing the number of particles deep inside the fluid or near thick flat surfaces. Further performance gains are achieved by varying the sampling density according to visual importance. In addition, we propose a novel fluid surface definition based on approximate particle–to–surface distances that are carried along with the particles and updated appropriately. The resulting surface reconstruction method has several advantages over existing methods, including stability under particle resampling and suitability for representing smooth flat surfaces. We demonstrate how our adaptive sampling and distancebased surface reconstruction algorithms lead to significant improvements in time and memory as compared to single resolution particle simulations, without significantly affecting the fluid flow behavior.” Adaptively Sampled Particle Fluids  Adaptively Sampled Particle Fluids http://www.agg.ethz.ch/publications/journal_and_conference   ## May 8th, 2007  ##  Fluids   ##  http://www.physicsbasedanimation.com/2007/05/08/adaptively-sampled-particle-fluids/  
 Continuous Collision Detection for Articulated Models using Taylor Models and Temporal Culling  ##   “We present a fast  continuous collision detection (CCD) algorithm for articulated models using  Taylor models and temporal culling. Our algorithm is a generalization of  conservative advancement (CA) from convex models [Mirtich 1996] to articulated  models with non-convex links. Given the initial and final configurations of a  moving articulated model, our algorithm creates a continuous motion with  constant translational and rotational velocities for each link, and checks for  interferences between the articulated model under continuous motion and other  models in the environment and for self-collisions. If collisions occur, our  algorithm reports the first time of contact (TOC) as well as collision witness  features. We have implemented our CCD algorithm and applied it to several  challenging scenarios including locomotion generation, articulated body dynamics  and character motion planning. Our algorithm can perform CCDs including  self-collisions for articulated models consisting of many links and tens of  thousands of triangles in 1.22 ms on average running on a 3.6 GHz Pentium 4 PC.

 Volume Conserving Finite Element Simulations of Deformable Models  ##   “We propose a numerical method for modeling highly deformable nonlinear incompressible solids that conserves the volume locally near each node in a finite element mesh. Our method works with arbitrary constitutive models, is applicable to both passive and active materials (e.g. muscles), and works with simple tetrahedra without the need for multiple quadrature points or stabilization techniques.  Although simple linear tetrahedra typically suffer from locking when modeling incompressible materials, our method enforces incompressibility per node (in a one-ring), and we demonstrate that it is free from locking. We correct errors in volume without introducing oscillations by treating position and velocity in separate implicit solves. Finally, we propose a novel method for treating both object contact and self-contact as linear constraints during the incompressible solve, alleviating issues in enforcing multiple possibly conflicting constraints.” Volume Conserving Finite Element Simulations of Deformable Models  Volume Conserving Finite Element Simulations of Deformable Models http://graphics.stanford.edu/~irving/   ## May 10th, 2007  ##  Deformables   ##  http://www.physicsbasedanimation.com/2007/05/10/volume-conserving-finite-element-simulations-of-deformable-models/

Building on the foundation of constrained Lagrangian mechanics, we propose weak-form constraints for tracking the input motion. This method allows the artist to choose where to add details such as characteristic wrinkles and folds of various thin shell materials and dynamical effects of physical forces.

 FastLSM: Fast Lattice Shape Matching for Robust Real-Time Deformation  ##   “We introduce a simple technique that enables robust approximation of volumetric, large-deformation dynamics for real-time or large-scale offline simulations. We propose Lattice Shape Matching, an extension of deformable shape matching to regular lattices with embedded geometry; lattice vertices are smoothed by convolution of rigid shape matching operators on local lattice regions, with the effective mechanical stiffness specified by the amount of smoothing via region width. Since the naive method can be very slow for stiff models — per-vertex costs scale cubically with region width — we provide a fast summation algorithm, Fast Lattice Shape Matching (FastLSM), that exploits the inherent summation redundancy of shape matching and can provide large-region matching at constant per-vertex cost. With this approach, large lattices can be simulated in linear time. We present several examples and benchmarks of an efficient CPU implementation, including many dozens of soft bodies simulated at real-time rates on a typical desktop machine.” FastLSM: Fast Lattice Shape Matching for Robust Real-Time Deformation  FastLSM: Fast Lattice Shape Matching for Robust Real-Time Deformation http://www.alecrivers.com/fastlsm/   ## May 13th, 2007  ##  Deformables   ##  http://www.physicsbasedanimation.com/2007/05/13/fastlsm-fast-lattice-shape-matching-for-robust-real-time-deformation/  
 Wrinkled Flames and Cellular Patterns  ##   “We model flames and fire using the Navier-Stokes equations combined with the level set method and jump conditions to model the reaction front. Previous works modeled the flame using a combination of propagation in the normal direction and a curvature term which leads to a level set equation that is parabolic in nature and thus overly dissipative and smooth. Asymptotic theory shows that one can obtain more interesting velocities and fully hyperbolic (as opposed to parabolic) equations for the level set evolution. In particular, researchers in the field of detonation shock dynamics (DSD) have derived a set of equations which exhibit characteristic cellular patterns. We show how to make use of the DSD framework in the context of computer graphics simulations of flames and fire to obtain interesting features such as flame wrinkling and cellular patterns.” Wrinkled Flames and Cellular Patterns  Wrinkled Flames and Cellular Patterns http://graphics.stanford.edu/~fedkiw/   ## May 14th, 2007  ##  Fire   ##  http://www.physicsbasedanimation.com/2007/05/14/wrinkled-flames-and-cellular-patterns/

 Wave Particles  ##   “We present a new method for the real-time simulation of fluid surface waves and their interactions with floating objects. The method is based on the new concept of wave particles, which offers a simple, fast, and unconditionally stable approach to wave simulation. We show how graphics hardware can be used to convert wave particles to a height field surface, which is warped horizontally to account for local wave-induced flow. The method is appropriate for most fluid simulation situations that do not involve significant global flow. It is demonstrated to work well in constrained areas, including wave reflections off of boundaries, and in unconstrained areas, such as an ocean surface. Interactions with floating objects are easily integrated by including wave forces on the objects and wave generation due to object motion. Theoretical foundations and implementation details are provided, and experiments demonstrate that we achieve plausible realism. Timing studies show that the method is scalable to allow simulation of wave interaction with several hundreds of objects at real-time rates.” Wave Particles  Wave Particles http://www.cemyuksel.com/research/waveparticles/   ## May 15th, 2007  ##  Fluids   ##  http://www.physicsbasedanimation.com/2007/05/15/wave-particles/  
 A Finite Element Method on Convex Polyhedra  ##    “We present a method for animating deformable objects using a novel finite element discretization on convex polyhedra. Our finite element approach draws upon recently introduced 3D mean value coordinates to define smooth interpolants within the elements. The mathematical properties of our basis functions guarantee convergence. Our method is a natural extension to linear interpolants on tetrahedra: for tetrahedral elements, the methods are identical. For fast and robust computations, we use an elasticity model based on Cauchy strain and stiffness warping. This more flexible discretization is particularly useful for simulations that involve topological changes, such as cutting or fracture. Since splitting convex elements along a plane produces convex elements, remeshing or subdivision schemes used in simulations based on tetrahedra are not necessary, leading to less elements after such operations. We propose various operators for cutting the polyhedral discretization. Our method can handle arbitrary cut trajectories, and there is no limit on how often elements can be split.” A Finite Element method on Convex Polyhedra  A Finite Element method on Convex Polyhedra http://graphics.ethz.ch/~wickem/publications.html   ## May 18th, 2007  ##  Deformables   ##  http://www.physicsbasedanimation.com/2007/05/18/a-finite-element-method-on-convex-polyhedra/

The MLS method uses surface markers and a level set for tracking the surface of the liquid, yielding more efficient and accurate results than popular methods like the Particle Level Set method (PLS). Another novelty is that the surface markers allow the MLS to handle non-diffusively surface texture advection, a rare capability in the realm of Eulerian simulation of liquids.

At each time step, semi-Lagrangian techniques are used to advect the fluid and its boundary forward, and a new conforming mesh is constructed over the fluid-occupied region. The tetrahedral meshes are built using a variation of the body centered cubic lattice structure that allows octree grading and deviation from the lattice structure at boundaries. The semi-regular mesh structure can be generated rapidly and allows efficient computation and storage while still conforming well to boundaries and providing a mesh-quality guarantee. Pressure projection is performed using an algebraic multigrid method, and a thickening scheme is used to reduce volume loss when fluid features shrink below mesh resolution. Examples demonstrate that the method can capture complex liquid motions that include fine detail on the free surfaces without suffering from excessive amounts of volume loss or artificial damping.” Liquid Simulation on Lattice-Based Tetrahedral Meshes  Liquid Simulation on Lattice-Based Tetrahedral Meshes http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/b-cam/Papers/Chentanez-2007-LSL/index.html   ## May 31st, 2007  ##  Fluids   ##  http://www.physicsbasedanimation.com/2007/05/31/liquid-simulation-on-lattice-based-tetrahedral-meshes/  
 Adaptive Deformations with Fast Tight Bounds  ##   “Simulation of deformations and collision detection are two highly intertwined problems that are often treated separately. This is especially true in existing elegant adaptive simulation techniques, where standard collision detection algorithms cannot leverage the adaptively selected degrees of freedom.We propose a seamless integration of multi-grid algorithms and collision detection that identifies boundary conditions while inherently exploiting adaptivity. We realize this integration through multiscale bounding hierarchies, a novel unified hierarchical representation, together with an adaptive multigrid algorithm for irregular meshes and an adaptivity-aware hierarchical collision detection algorithm.

 Arbitrary Cutting of Deformable Tetrahedralized Objects  ##   We propose a flexible geometric algorithm for placing arbitrary cracks and incisions on tetrahedralized deformable objects. Although techniques based on remeshing can also accommodate arbitrary fracture patterns, this flexibility comes at the risk of creating sliver elements leading to models that are inappropriate for subsequent simulation. Furthermore, interactive applications such as virtual surgery simulation require both a relatively low resolution mesh for efficient simulation of elastic deformation and highly detailed surface geometry to facilitate accurate manipulation and cut placement. Thus, we embed a high resolution material boundary mesh into a coarser tetrahedral mesh using our cutting algorithm as a meshing tool, obtaining meshes that can be efficiently simulated while preserving surface detail. Our algorithm is similar to the virtual node algorithm in that we avoid sliver elements and their associated stringent timestep restrictions, but it is significantly more general allowing for the arbitrary cutting of existing cuts, sub-tetrahedron resolution (e.g. we cut a single tetrahedron into over a thousand pieces), progressive introduction of cuts while the object is deforming, and moreover the ability to accurately cut the high resolution embedded mesh.

 Hybrid Simulation of Deformable Solids  ##   Although mesh-based methods are efficient for simulating simple hyperelasticity, maintaining and adapting a mesh-based representation is less appealing in more complex scenarios, e.g. collision, plasticity and fracture. Thus, meshless or point-based methods have enjoyed recent popularity due to their added flexibility in dealing with these situations. Our approach begins with an initial mesh that is either conforming (as generated by one’s favorite meshing algorithm) or non-conforming (e.g. a BCC background lattice). We then propose a framework for embedding arbitrary sample points into this initial mesh allowing for the straightforward handling of collisions, plasticity and fracture without the need for complex remeshing. A straightforward consequence of this new framework is the ability to naturally handle T-junctions alleviating the requirement for a manifold initial mesh. The arbitrarily added embedded points are endowed with full simulation capability allowing them to collide, interact with each other, and interact with the parent geometry in the fashion of a particle-centric simulation system. We demonstrate how this formulation facilitates tasks such as arbitrary refinement or resampling for collision processing, the handling of multiple and possibly conflicting constraints (e.g. when cloth is nonphysically pinched between two objects), the straightforward treatment of fracture, and sub-element resolution of elasticity and plasticity.

 Weakly Compressible SPH for Free Surface Flows  ##   We present a weakly compressible form of the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics method (SPH) for fluid flow based on the Tait equation. In contrast to commonly employed projection approaches that strictly enforce incompressibility, time-consuming solvers for the Poisson equation are avoided by allowing for small, user-defined density fluctuations. We also discuss an improved surface tension model that is particularly appropriate for single-phase free-surface flows. The proposed model is compared to existing models and experiments illustrate the accuracy of the approach for free surface flows. Combining the proposed methods, volume-preserving low-viscosity liquids can be efficiently simulated using SPH. The approach is appropriate for medium-scale and small-scale phenomena. Effects such as splashing and breaking waves are naturally handled.

 CORDE: Cosserat Rod Elements for the Dynamic Simulation of One-Dimensional Elastic Objects  ##   Simulating one-dimensional elastic objects such as threads, ropes or hair strands is a difficult problem, especially if material torsion is considered. In this paper, we present CORDE(french ’rope’), a novel deformation model for the dynamic interactive simulation of elastic rods with torsion. We derive continuous energies for a dynamically deforming rod based on the Cosserat theory of elastic rods. We then discretize the rod and compute energies per element by employing finite element methods. Thus, the global dynamic behavior is independent of the discretization. The dynamic evolution of the rod is obtained by numerical integration of the resulting Lagrange equations of motion. We further show how this system of equations can be decoupled and efficiently solved. Since the centerline of the rod is explicitly represented, the deformation model allows for accurate contact and self-contact handling. Thus, we can reproduce many important looping phenomena. Further, a broad variety of different materials can be simulated at interactive rates. Experiments underline the physical plausibility of our deformation model.

 Screen Space Meshes  ##    We present a simple yet powerful approach for the generation and rendering of surfaces defined by the boundary of a three-dimensional point cloud. First, a depth map plus internal and external silhouettes of the surface are generated in screen space. These are used to construct a 2D screen space triangle mesh with a new technique that is derived from Marching Squares. The resulting mesh is transformed back to 3D world space for the computation of occlusions, reflections, refraction, and other shading effects. One of the main applications for screen space meshes is the visualization of Lagrangian, particle-based fluids models. Our new method has several advantages over the full 3D Marching Cubes approach. The algorithm only generates surface where it is visible, view-dependent level of detail comes for free, and interesting visual effects are possible by filtering in screen space.

 Time-critical distributed contact for 6-DoF haptic rendering of adaptively sampled reduced deformable models  ##   Real-time evaluation of distributed contact forces for rigid or deformable 3D objects is important for providing multi-sensory feedback in emerging real-time applications, such as 6-DoF haptic force-feedback rendering. Unfortunately, at very high temporal rates (1 kHz for haptics), there is often insufficient time to resolve distributed contact between geometrically complex objects. In this paper, we present a spatially and temporally adaptive sample-based approach to approximate contact forces under hard real-time constraints. The approach is CPU based, and supports contact between a rigid and a reduced deformable model with complex geometry. Penalty-based contact forces are efficiently resolved using a multi-resolution point-based representation for one object, and a signed-distance field for the other. Hard realtime approximation of distributed contact forces uses multi-level progressive point-contact sampling, and exploits temporal coherence, graceful degradation and other optimizations. We present several examples of 6-DoF haptic rendering of geometrically complex rigid and deformable objects in distributed contact at real-time kilohertz rates.

 Legendre Fluids: A Unified Framework for Analytic Reduced Space Modeling and Rendering of Participating Media  ##   In this paper, we present a unified framework for reduced space modeling and rendering of dynamic and nonhomogenous participating media, like snow, smoke, dust and fog. The key idea is to represent the 3D spatial variation of the density, velocity and intensity fields of the media using the same analytic basis. In many situations, natural effects such as mist, outdoor smoke and dust are smooth (low frequency) phenomena, and can be compactly represented by a small number of coefficients of a Legendre polynomial basis. We derive analytic expressions for the derivative and integral operators in the Legendre coefficient space, as well as the triple product integrals of Legendre polynomials. These mathematical results allow us to solve both the Navier-Stokes equations for fluid flow and light transport equations for single scattering efficiently in the reduced Legendre space. Since our technique does not depend on volume grid resolution, we can achieve computational speedups as compared to spatial domain methods while having low memory and pre-computation requirements as compared to datadriven approaches. Also, analytic definition of derivatives and integral operators in the Legendre domain avoids the approximation errors inherent in spatial domain finite difference methods. We demonstrate many interesting visual effects resulting from particles immersed in fluids as well as volumetric scattering in non-homogenous and dynamic participating media, such as fog and mist.

 Real-time Simulations of Bubbles and Foam within a Shallow-Water Framework  ##   Bubbles and foam are important fluid phenomena on scales that we encounter in our lives every day. While different techniques to handle these effects were developed in the past years, they require a full 3D fluid solver with free surfaces and surface tension. We present a shallow water based particle model that is coupled with a smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulation to demonstrate that real-time simulations of bubble and foam effects are possible with high frame rates. A shallow water simulation is used to represent the overall water volume. It is coupled to a particle-based bubble simulation with a flow field of spherical vortices. This bubble simulation is interacting with a smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulation including surface tension to handle foam on the fluid surface. The realism and performance of our approach is demonstrated with several test cases that run with high frame rates on a standard PC.

 Cubic Shells  ##   Hinge-based bending models are widely used in the physically-based animation of cloth, thin plates and shells. We propose a hinge-based model that is simpler to implement, more efficient to compute, and offers a greater number of effective material parameters than existing models. Our formulation builds on two mathematical observations: (a) the bending energy of curved flexible surfaces can be expressed as a cubic polynomial if the surface does not stretch; (b) a general class of anisotropic materials—those that are orthotropic—is captured by appropriate choice of a single stiffness per hinge. Our contribution impacts a general range of surface animation applications, from isotropic cloth and thin plates to orthotropic fracturing thin shells.

 Animation of Chemically Reactive Fluids using a Hybrid Simulation Method  ##   Chemical phenomena abound in the real world, and often comprise indispensable elements of visual effects that are routinely created in the film industry. In this paper, we present a hybrid technique for simulating chemically reactive fluids, based on the theory of chemical kinetics. Our method makes synergistic use of both Eulerian grid-based methods and Lagrangian particle methods to simulate real and hypothetical chemical mechanisms effectively and efficiently. We demonstrate that by modeling chemical reactions using a particle system, an established, physically based fluid system can be extended easily to generate a wide range of chemical phenomena, ranging from catalysis and erosion to fire and explosions, with only a small additional cost.

 Real-Time Simulation of Thin Shells  ##   This paper proposes a real-time simulation technique for thin shells undergoing large deformation. Shells are thin objects such as leaves and papers that can be abstracted as 2D structures. Development of a satisfactory physical model that runs in real-time but produces visually convincing animation of thin shells has been remaining a challenge in computer graphics. Rather than resorting to shell theory which involves the most complex formulations in continuum mechanics, we adopt the energy functions from the discrete shells proposed by Grinspun et al. [GHDS03]. For real-time integration of the governing equation, we develop a modal warping technique for shells. This new simulation framework results from making extensions to the original modal warping technique [CK05] which was developed for the simulation of 3D solids. We report experimental results, which show that the proposed method runs in real-time even for large meshes, and that it can simulate large bending and/or twisting deformations with acceptable realism.

 A Simple Boiling Module  ##   Recent efforts to visually capture the phenomena of boiling have proposed monolithic approaches that extend the basic techniques underlying existing fluid solvers. In this work, we show that if we instead treat boiling as a separate computational module to be loosely coupled to an existing solver, a very easy to implement, highly efficient algorithm can be designed that produces excellent visual results, even on coarse (64^3) grids. The algorithm is also highly SIMD-amenable, allowing the boiling computation to be farmed out to a GPU or Playstation 3 Cell processor. Our algorithm takes less than 100 lines of commented, readable C++, and can be integrated into an existing particle level set fluid solver with virtually no modifications. A serial implementation consumes between 3-5% of the overall running time, and a preliminary SIMD implementation shows that a 64^3 simulation runs at 130 FPS, making the computational cost of the module totally negligible.

 Efficient Refinement of Dynamic Point Data  ##   Particle simulations as well as geometric modeling techniques have demonstrated their ability to process and render points interactively. However, real-time particle-based fluid simulations suffer from poor rendering quality due to low surface particle resolutions. Surfaces appear blobby, surface details are lost, and features like edges are degraded due to smoothing effects. This paper presents a novel point refinement method for irregularly sampled, dynamic points coming from a particle-based fluid simulation. Our interpolation algorithm can handle complex geometries including splashes, and at the same time preserves features like edges. Point collisions are avoided resulting in a nearly uniform sampling facilitating surface reconstruction techniques. No point preprocessing is necessary, and point neighborhoods are dynamically updated reducing computation and memory costs. We show that our algorithm can efficiently detect and refine the surface points of a fluid and we demonstrate the improvement of rendering quality and applicability to real-time simulations.

 Many Worlds Browsing for Control of Multibody Dynamics  ##    Animation techniques for controlling passive simulation are commonly based on an optimization paradigm: the user provides goals a priori, and sophisticated numerical methods minimize a cost function that represents these goals.  Unfortunately, for multibody systems with discontinuous contact events these optimization problems can be highly nontrivial to solve, and many-hour offline optimizations, unintuitive parameters, and convergence failures can frustrate end-users and limit usage. On the other hand, users are quite adaptable, and systems which provide interactive feedback via an intuitive interface can leverage the user’s own abilities to quickly produce interesting animations.  However, the online computation necessary for interactivity limits scene complexity in practice. We introduce Many-Worlds Browsing, a method which circumvents these limits by exploiting the speed of multibody simulators to compute numerous example simulations in parallel (offline and online), and allow the user to browse and modify them interactively.  We demonstrate intuitive interfaces through which the user can select among the examples and interactively adjust those parts of the scene that don’t match his requirements.  We show that using a combination of our techniques, unusual and interesting results can be generated for moderately sized scenes with under an hour of user time. Scalability is demonstrated by sampling much larger scenes using modest offline computations.

 Real-Time Breaking Waves for Shallow Water Simulations  ##   We present a new method for enhancing shallow water simulations by the effect of overturning waves. While full 3D fluid simulations can capture the process of wave breaking, this is beyond the capabilities of a pure height field model. 3D simulations, however, are still too expensive for real-time applications, especially when large bodies of water need to be simulated. The extension we propose overcomes this problem and makes it possible to simulate scenes such as waves near a beach, and surf riding characters in real-time. In a first step, steep wave fronts in the height field are detected and marked by line segments. These segments then spawn sheets of fluid represented by connected particles. When the sheets impinge on the water surface, they are absorbed and result in the creation of particles representing drops and foam. To enable interesting applications, we furthermore present a two-way coupling of rigid bodies with the fluid simulation. The capabilities and efficiency of the method will be demonstrated with several scenes, which run in real-time on today’s commodity hardware.

Subsequently, reaction-diffusion systems have been studied in many fields, including computer graphics. We first show that for visual simulation purposes, reaction-diffusion equations can be made unconditionally stable using a variety of straightforward methods. Second, we propose an anisotropy embedding that significantly expands the space of possible patterns that can be generated. Third, we show that by adding an advection term, the simulation can be coupled to a fluid simulation to produce visually appealing flows. Fourth, we couple fast marching methods to our anisotropy embedding to create a painting interface to the simulation. Unconditional stability to maintained throughout, and our system runs at interactive rates. Finally, we show that on the Cell processor, it is possible to implement reaction-diffusion on top of an existing fluid solver with no significant performance impact.

 Solving General Shallow Wave Equations on Surfaces  ##   We propose a new framework for solving General Shallow Wave Equations (GSWE) in order to efficiently simulate water flows on solid surfaces under shallow wave assumptions. Within this framework, we develop implicit schemes for solving the external forces applied to water, including gravity and surface tension. We also present a two-way coupling method to model interactions between fluid and floating rigid objects. Water flows in this system can be simulated not only on planar surfaces by using regular grids, but also on curved surfaces directly without surface parametrization. The experiments show that our system is fast, stable, physically sound, and straightforward to implement on both CPUs and GPUs. It is capable of simulating a variety of water effects including: shallow waves, water drops, rivulets, capillary events and fluid/floating rigid body coupling. Because the system is fast, we can also achieve real-time water drop control and shape design.

 Impulse-Based Dynamic Simulation in Linear Time  ##   This paper describes an impulse-based dynamic simulation method for articulated bodies which has a linear time complexity. Existing linear-time methods are either based on a reduced-coordinate formulation or on Lagrange multipliers. The impulse-based simulation has advantages over these well-known methods. Unlike reduced-coordinate methods, it handles nonholonomic constraints like velocity-dependent ones and is very easy to implement. In contrast to Lagrange multiplier methods the impulse-based approach has no drift problem and an additional stabilisation is not necessary. The presented method computes a simulation step in O(n) time for acyclic multi-body systems containing equality constraints. Closed kinematic chains can be handled by dividing the model into different acyclic parts. Each of these parts is solved independently from each other. The dependencies between the single parts are solved by an iterative method. In the same way inequality constraints can be integrated in the simulation process in order to handle collisions and permanent contacts with dynamic and static friction.

We remove mass from an object by treating its surface as a level set and advecting it inward, and we deposit the chemical and physical byproducts into simulated fluid. Similarly, our technique deposits sediment onto a surface by advecting the level set outward.

 Eulerian Motion Blur  ##   This paper describes a motion blur technique which can be applied to rendering fluid simulations that are carried out in the Eulerian framework. Existing motion blur techniques can be applied to rigid bodies, deformable solids, clothes, and several other kinds of objects, and produce satisfactory results. As there is no specific reason to discriminate fluids from the above objects, one may consider applying an existing motion blur technique to render fluids. However, here we show that existing motion blur techniques are intended for simulations carried out in the Lagrangian framework, and are not suited to Eulerian simulations. Then, we propose a new motion blur technique that is suitable for rendering Eulerian simulations.

To preserve the sharp detail of the target shape, we represent it as an implicit function and construct the level-set of that function. Previous approaches add the target-driven control force as an external term, which then becomes attenuated during the velocity projection step, making the convergence process unstable and causing sharp detail to be lost from the target shape. But we calculate the force on the fluid from the pressure discontinuity at the interface between phases, and integrate the control force into the projection step so as to preserve its effect. The control force is calculated using an enhanced version of the ghost fluid method (GFM), which guarantees that the fluid flows from the source shape and converges into the target shape, while achieving a more natural animation than other approaches. Our control force is merged during the projection step avoiding the need for a post-optimization process to eliminate divergence at the liquid interface. This makes our method easy to implement using existing fluid engines and it incurs little computational overhead. Experimental results show the accuracy and robustness of this technique.

 Level Set Driven Flows  ##   In 2D, incompressible flows, the Stokes equations that represent the dynamics of very viscous flows and vorticity formulation of hydrodynamic equations both reduce to a scalar stream-function representation in terms of elliptic equations. By making use of this simplification and the properties of Fourier space representation of elliptic equations, we use a common spectral method to solve both of these equations. Based on this system of equations, we propose a level set based input description which provides a flexible environment for the user to model a wide range of flows and artistic effects in 2D. This input type allows the modeling of vortex sheet patterns and other complex flows with a very practical approach and chaotic, dynamic flows, even with viscous Stokes equations. A user interface is developed for the level set input which allows the user to draw the strokes or edit the level set data by applying transformation functions or perturbations. To sum up, this model can be used for the simulation of very viscous flows, vorticity dynamics, vortex sheet patterns, turbulent and chaotic flows as well as other artistic effects such as the traditional marbling patterns, with a simple, fast and stable system at high resolutions.

 Two-Way Coupled SPH and Particle Level Set Fluid Simulation  ##            Grid-based methods have difficulty resolving features         on or below the scale of the underlying grid. Although          adaptive methods (e.g. RLE, octrees) can alleviate this to some          degree, separate techniques are still required for simulating          small-scale phenomena such as spray and foam, especially since          these more diffuse materials typically behave quite differently          than their denser counterparts. In this paper, we propose a two-way         coupled simulation framework that uses the particle level set          method to efficiently model dense liquid volumes and a smoothed          particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method to simulate diffuse regions          such as sprays. Our novel SPH method allows us to simulate both          dense and diffuse water volumes, fully incorporates the particles          that are automatically generated by the particle level set method          in under-resolved regions, and allows for two way mixing between          dense SPH volumes and grid-based liquid representations.

 A Fast and Stable Penalty Method for Rigid Body Simulation  ##   Two methods have been used extensively to model resting contact for rigid body simulation. The first approach, the penalty method, applies virtual springs to surfaces in contact to minimize interpenetration. This method, as typically implemented, results in oscillatory behavior and considerable penetration. The second approach, based on formulating resting contact as a linear complementarity problem, determines the resting contact forces analytically to prevent interpenetration. The analytical method exhibits expected-case polynomial complexity in the number of contact points, and may fail to find a solution in polynomial time when friction is modeled. We present a fast penalty method that minimizes oscillatory behavior and leads to little penetration during resting contact; our method compares favorably to the analytical method with regard to these two measures, while exhibiting much faster performance both asymptotically and empirically.

 An Adaptive Contact Model for the Robust Simulation of Knots  ##   In this paper, we present an adaptive model for dynamically deforming hyper-elastic rods. In contrast to existing approaches, adaptively introduced control points are not governed by geometric subdivision rules. Instead, their states are determined by employing a non-linear energy-minimization approach. Since valid control points are computed instantaneously, post-stabilization schemes are avoided and the stability of the dynamic simulation is improved.  Due to inherently complex contact configurations, the simulation of knot tying using rods is a challenging task. In order to address this problem, we combine our adaptive model with a robust and accurate collision handling method for elastic rods. By employing our scheme, complex knot configurations can be simulated in a physically plausible way.

 Fast Collision Detection for Deformable Models using Representative-Triangles  ##   We present a new approach to accelerate collision detection for deformable models. Our formulation applies to all triangulated models and significantly reduces the number of elementary tests between features of the mesh, i.e., vertices, edges and faces. We introduce the notion of Representative-Triangles, standard geometric triangles augmented with mesh feature information and use this representation to achieve better collision query performance. The resulting approach can be combined with bounding volume hierarchies and works well for both inter-object and self-collision detection. We demonstrate the benefit of Representative-Triangles on continuous collision detection for cloth simulation and N-body collision scenarios. We observe up to a one-order of magnitude reduction in feature-pair tests and up to a 5X improvement in query time.

 Hardware-Aware Analysis and Optimization of Stable Fluids  ##    We perform a detailed flop and bandwidth analysis of Jos Stam’s Stable Fluids algorithm on the CPU, GPU, and Cell. In all three cases, we find that the algorithm is bandwidth bound, with the cores sitting idle up to 96% of the time. Knowing this, we propose two modifications to accelerate the algorithm. First, a Mehrstellen discretization for the pressure solver which reduces the running time of the solver by a third. Second, a static caching scheme that eliminates roughly 99% of the random lookups in the advection stage. We observe a 2x speedup in the advection stage using this scheme. Both modifications apply equally well to all three architectures.

 A Fast Simulation Method Using Overlapping Grids for Interaction Between Smoke and Rigid Objects  ##   Recently, many techniques using computational fluid dynamics have been proposed for the simulation of natural phenomena such as smoke and fire. Traditionally, a single grid is used for computing the motion of fluids. When an object interacts with a fluid, the resolution of the grid must be sufficiently high because the shape of the object is represented by a shape sampled at the grid points. This increases the number of grid points that are required, and hence the computational cost is increased. To address this problem, we propose a method using multiple grids that overlap with each other. In addition to a large single grid (a global grid) that covers the whole of the simulation space, separate grids (local grids) are generated that surround each object. The resolution of a local grid is higher than that of the global grid. The local grids move according to the motion of the objects. Therefore, the process of resampling the shape of the object is unnecessary when the object moves. To accelerate the computation, appropriate resolutions are adaptively-determined for the local grids according to their distance from the viewpoint. Furthermore, since we use regular (orthogonal) lattices for the grids, the method is suitable for GPU implementation. This realizes the real-time simulation of interactions between objects and smoke.

 Animating developable surfaces using nonconforming elements  ##   We present a new discretization for the physics-based animation of developable surfaces. Constrained to not deform at all in-plane but free to bend out-of-plane, these are an excellent approximation for many materials, including most cloth, paper, and stiffer materials. Unfortunately the conforming (geometrically continuous) discretizations used in graphics break down in this limit. Our nonconforming approach solves this problem, allowing us to simulate surfaces with zero in-plane deformation as a hard constraint. However, it produces discontinuous meshes, so we further couple this with a “ghost” conforming mesh for collision processing and rendering. We also propose a new second order accurate constrained mechanics time integration method that greatly reduces the numerical damping present in the usual first order methods used in graphics, for virtually no extra cost and sometimes significant speed-up.

 Fast Viscoelastic Behavior with Thin Features  ##   We introduce a method for efficiently animating a wide range of deformable materials. We combine a high resolution surface mesh with a tetrahedral finite element simulator that makes use of frequent re-meshing. This combination allows for fast and detailed simulations of complex elastic and plastic behavior. We significantly expand the range of physical parameters that can be simulated with a single technique, and the results are free from common artifacts such as volume-loss, smoothing, popping, and the absence of thin features like strands and sheets. Our decision to couple a high resolution surface with low-resolution physics leads to efficient simulation and detailed surface features, and our approach to creating the tetrahedral mesh leads to an order-of-magnitude speedup over previous techniques in the time spent re-meshing. We compute masses, collisions, and surface tension forces on the scale of the fine mesh, which helps avoid visual artifacts due to the differing mesh resolutions. The result is a method that can simulate a large array of different material behaviors with high resolution features in a short amount of time.

 Discrete Elastic Rods  ##   We present a discrete treatment of adapted framed curves,          parallel transport, and holonomy, thus establishing the          language for a discrete geometric model of thin flexible rods          with arbitrary cross section and undeformed          configuration. Our approach differs from existing simulation          techniques in the graphics and mechanics literature both in          the kinematic description — we represent the material          frame by its angular deviation from the natural Bishop frame          — as well as in the dynamical treatment — we          treat the centerline as dynamic and the material frame as          quasistatic. Additionally, we describe a manifold projection          method for coupling rods to rigid-bodies and simultaneously          enforcing rod inextensibility.  The use of quasistatics and          constraints provides an efficient treatment for stiff          twisting and stretching modes; at the same time, we retain          the dynamic bending of the centerline and accurately          reproduce the coupling between bending and twisting modes.          We validate the discrete rod model via quantitative buckling,          stability, and coupled-mode experiments, and via qualitative          knot-tying comparisons.

 Porous Flow in Particle-Based Fluid Simulations  ##   This paper presents the simulation of fluid flowing through a porous deformable material. We introduce the physical principles governing porous flow, expressed by the Law of Darcy, into the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) framework for simulating fluids and deformable objects. Contrary to previous SPH approaches, we simulate porous flow at a macroscopic scale, making abstraction of individual pores or cavities inside the material. Thus, the number of computational elements is kept low, while at the same time realistic simulations can be achieved. Our algorithm models the changing behavior of the wet material as well as the full two-way coupling between the fluid and the porous material. This enables various new effects, such as the simulation of sponge-like elastic bodies and water-absorbing sticky cloth.

 Spline Joints for Multibody Dynamics  ##   Spline joints are a novel class of joints that can model general scleronomic constraints for multibody dynamics based on the minimalcoordinates formulation. The main idea is to introduce spline curves and surfaces in the modeling of joints: We model 1-DOF joints using splines on SE(3), and construct multi-DOF joints as the product of exponentials of splines in Euclidean space. We present efficient recursive algorithms to compute the derivatives of the spline joint, as well as geometric algorithms to determine optimal parameters in order to achieve the desired joint motion. Our spline joints can be used to create interesting new simulated mechanisms for computer animation and they can more accurately model complex biomechanical joints such as the knee and shoulder.

 Bubbles Alive  ##   We propose a hybrid method for simulating multiphase fluids such as bubbly water. The appearance of subgrid visual details is improved by incorporating a new bubble model based on smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) into an Eulerian grid-based simulation that handles background flows of large bodies of water and air. To overcome the difficulty in simulating small bubbles in the context of the multiphase flows on a coarse grid, we heuristically model the interphase properties of water and air by means of the interactions between bubble particles. As a result, we can animate lively motion of bubbly water with small scale details efficiently.

 Robust Treatment of Simultaneous Collisions  ##   Robust treatment of complex collisions is a challenging problem in cloth simulation. Some state of the art methods resolve collisions iteratively, invoking a fail-safe when a bound on iteration count is exceeded. The best-known fail-safe rigidifies the contact region, causing simulation artifacts. We present a fail-safe that cancels impact but not sliding motion, considerably reducing artificial dissipation. We equip the proposed fail-safe with an approximation of Coulomb friction, allowing finer control of sliding dissipation.

 Wavelet Turbulence for Fluid Simulation  ##   We present a novel wavelet method for the simulation of fluids at high spatial resolution. The algorithm enables large- and small-scale detail to be edited separately, allowing high-resolution detail to be added as a post-processing step. Instead of solving the Navier-Stokes equations over a highly refined mesh, we use the wavelet decomposition of a low-resolution simulation to determine the location and energy characteristics of missing high-frequency components. We then synthesize these missing components using a novel incompressible turbulence function, and provide a method to maintain the temporal coherence of the resulting structures. There is no linear system to solve, so the method parallelizes trivially and requires only a few auxiliary arrays. The method guarantees that the new frequencies will not interfere with existing frequencies, allowing animators to set up a low resolution simulation quickly and later add details without changing the overall fluid motion.

 Flexible Simulation of Deformable Models using Discontinuous Galerkin FEM  ##   We propose a simulation technique for elastically deformable objects based on the discontinuous Galerkin finite element method (DG FEM). In contrast to traditional FEM, it overcomes the restrictions of conforming basis functions by allowing for discontinuous elements with weakly enforced continuity constraints. This added flexibility enables the simulation of arbitrarily shaped, convex and non-convex polyhedral elements, while still using simple polynomial basis functions. For the accurate strain integration over these elements we propose an analytic technique based on the divergence theorem. Being able to handle arbitrary elements eventually allows us to derive simple and efficient techniques for volumetric mesh generation, adaptive mesh refinement, and robust cutting.

 Accurate Viscous Free Surfaces for Buckling, Coiling and Rotating Liquids  ##   We present a fully implicit Eulerian technique for simulating free surface viscous liquids which eliminates artifacts in previous approaches, efficiently supports variable viscosity, and allows the simulation of more compelling viscous behaviour than previously achieved in graphics. Our method exploits a variational principle which automatically enforces the complex boundary condition on the shear stress at the free surface, while giving rise to a simple discretization with a symmetric positive definite linear system. We demonstrate examples of our technique capturing realistic buckling, folding and coiling behavior. In addition, we explain how to handle domains whose boundary comprises both ghost fluid Dirichlet and variational Neumann parts, allowing correct behaviour at free surfaces and solid walls for both our viscous solve and the variational pressure projection of [Batty et al. 2007].

 Simulating Knitted Cloth at the Yarn Level  ##   Knitted fabric is widely used in clothing because of its unique and stretchy behavior, which is fundamentally different from the behavior of woven cloth. The properties of knits come from the nonlinear, three-dimensional kinematics of long, inter-looping yarns, and despite significant advances in cloth animation we still do not know how to simulate knitted fabric faithfully. Existing cloth simulators mainly adopt elastic-sheet mechanical models inspired by woven materials, focusing less on the model itself than on important simulation challenges such as efficiency, stability, and robustness. We define a new computational model for knits in terms of the motion of yarns, rather than the motion of a sheet. Each yarn is modeled as an inextensible, yet otherwise flexible, B-spline tube. To simulate complex knitted garments, we propose an implicit-explicit integrator, with yarn inextensibility constraints imposed using efficient projections. Friction among yarns is approximated using rigid-body velocity filters, and key yarn-yarn interactions are mediated by stiff penalty forces. Our results show that this simple model predicts the key mechanical properties of different knits, as demonstrated by qualitative comparisons to observed deformations of actual samples in the laboratory, and that the simulator can scale up to substantial animations with complex dynamic motion.

 A Mass Spring Model for Hair Simulation  ##   Our goal is to simulate the full hair geometry, consisting of ap- proximately one hundred thousand hairs on a typical human head. This will require scalable methods that can simulate every hair as opposed to only a few guide hairs. Novel to this approach is that the individual hair/hair interactions can be modeled with physical parameters (friction, static attraction, etc.) at the scale of a single hair as opposed to clumped or continuum interactions. In this vein, we ﬁrst propose a new altitude spring model for preventing col- lapse in the simulation of volumetric tetrahedra, and we show that it is also applicable both to bending in cloth and torsion in hair. We demonstrate that this new torsion model for hair behaves in a fashion similar to more sophisticated models with signiﬁcantly reduced computational cost. For added efﬁciency, we introduce a semi-implicit discretization of standard springs that makes them truly linear in multiple spatial dimensions and thus unconditionally stable without requiring Newton-Raphson iteration. We also simu- late complex hair/hair interactions including sticking and clumping behavior, collisions with objects (e.g. head and shoulders) and self- collisions. Notably, in line with our goal to simulate the full head of hair, we do not generate any new hairs at render time.

 Robust High-Resolution Cloth using Parallelism, History-Based Collisions and Accurate Friction  ##   In this paper we simulate high resolution cloth consisting of up to 2 million triangles which allows us to achieve highly detailed folds and wrinkles. Since the level of detail is also inﬂuenced by object collision and self collision, we propose a more accurate model for cloth-object friction. We also propose a robust history-based repulsion/collision framework where repulsions are treated accurately and efﬁciently on a per time step basis. Distributed memory parallelism is used for both time evolution and collisions and we speciﬁcally address Gauss-Seidel ordering of repulsion/collision response. This algorithm is demonstrated by several high-resolution and high-ﬁdelity simulations.

 Image-based Collision Detection and Response between Arbitrary Volume Objects  ##   We present a new image-based method to process contacts between objects bounded by triangular surfaces. Unlike previous methods, it relies on image-based volume minimization, which eliminates complex geometrical computations and robustly handles deep intersections.  The surfaces are rasterized in three orthogonal directions, and intersections are detected based on pixel depth and normal orientation. Per-pixel contact forces are computed and accumulated at the vertices. We show how to compute pressure forces which serve to minimize the intersection volume, as well as friction forces. No geometrical precomputation is required, which makes the method efficient for both deformable and rigid objects. We demonstrate it on rigid, skinned, and particle-based physical models with detailed surfaces in contacts at interactive frame rates.

 Evolving Sub-Grid Turbulence for Smoke Animation  ##   We introduce a simple turbulence model for smoke animation, qualitatively capturing the transport, diffusion, and spectral cascade of turbulent energy unresolved on a typical simulation grid. We track the mean kinetic energy per octave of turbulence in each grid cell, and a novel “net rotation” variable for modeling the self-advection of turbulent eddies. These additions to a standard fluid solver drive a procedural post-process, layering plausible dynamically evolving turbulent details on top of the large-scale simulated motion. Finally, to make the most of the simulation grid before jumping to procedural sub-grid models, we propose a new multistep predictor to alleviate the nonphysical dissipation of angular momentum in standard graphics fluid solvers.

 Two-Way Coupling of Fluids to Rigid and Deformable Solids and Shells  ##   We propose a novel solid/fluid coupling method that treats the coupled system in a fully implicit manner making it stable for arbitrary time steps, large density ratios, etc. In contrast to previous work in computer graphics, we derive our method using a simple back-of-the-envelope approach which lumps the solid and fluid momenta together, and which we show exactly conserves the momentum of the coupled system. Notably, our method uses the standard Cartesian fluid discretization and does not require (moving) conforming tetrahedral meshes or ALE frameworks. Furthermore, we use a standard Lagrangian framework for the solid, thus supporting arbitrary solid constitutive models, both implicit and explicit time integration, etc. The method is quite general, working for smoke, water, and multiphase fluids as well as both rigid and deformable solids, and both volumes and thin shells. Rigid shells and cloth are handled automatically without special treatment, and we support fully one-sided discretizations without leaking. Our equations are fully symmetric, allowing for the use of fast solvers, which is a natural result of properly conserving momentum. Finally, for simple explicit time integration of rigid bodies, we show that our equations reduce to a form similar to previous work via a single block Gaussian elimination operation, but that this approach scales poorly, i.e. as though in four spatial dimensions rather than three.

 Two-way Coupling of Rigid and Deformable Bodies  ##   We propose a framework for the full two-way coupling of rigid and deformable bodies, which is achieved with both a unified time integration scheme as well as individual two-way coupled algorithms at each point of that scheme. As our algorithm is two-way coupled in every fashion, we do not require ad hoc methods for dealing with stability issues or interleaving parts of the simulation. We maintain the ability to treat the key desirable aspects of rigid bodies (e.g. contact, collision, stacking, and friction) and deformable bodies (e.g. arbitrary constitutive models, thin shells, and self-collisions). In addition, our simulation framework supports more advanced features such as proportional derivative controlled articulation between rigid bodies. This not only allows for the robust simulation of a number of new phenomena, but also directly lends itself to the design of deformable creatures with proportional derivative controlled articulated rigid skeletons that interact in a life-like way with their environment.

 Density Contrast SPH Interfaces  ##   To simulate multiple fluids realistically many important interaction effects have to be captured accurately. Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) has shown to be a simple, yet flexible method to cope with many fluid simulation problems in a robust way. Unfortunately, the results obtained when using SPH to simulate miscible fluids are severely affected, especially if density ratios become large. The undesirable effects reach from unphysical density and pressure variations to spurious and unnatural interface tensions, as well as severe numerical instabilities. In this work, we present a formulation based on SPH which can handle density discontinuities at interfaces between multiple fluids correctly without increasing the computational costs compared to standard SPH. The basic idea is to replace the density computation in SPH by a measure of particle densities and consequently derive new formulations for pressure and viscous forces. The new method enables the user to select the desired amount of interface tension according to the simulation problem at hand. We succeed to stably simulate multiple fluids with high density contrasts without the above described artifacts apparent in standard SPH simulations.

 Low Viscosity Flow Simulations for Animation  ##   We present a combination of techniques to simulate turbulent fluid flows in 3D. Flow in a complex domain is modeled using a regular rectilinear grid with a finite-difference solution to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. We propose the use of the QUICK advection algorithm over a globally high resolution grid. To calculate pressure over the grid, we introduce the Iterated Orthogonal Projection (IOP) framework. In IOP a series of orthogonal projections ensures that multiple conditions such as non-divergence and boundary conditions arising through complex domains shapes or moving objects will be satisfied simultaneously to specified accuracy. This framework allows us to use a simple and highly efficient multigrid method to enforce non-divergence in combination with complex domain boundary conditions. IOP is amenable to GPU implementation, resulting in over an order of magnitude improvement over a CPU-based solver. We analyze the impact of these algorithms on the turbulent energy cascade in simulated fluid flows and the resulting visual quality.

 Fast Adaptive Shape Matching Deformations  ##   We present a new shape-matching deformation model that allows for efficient handling of topological changes and dynamic adaptive selection of levels of detail. Similar to the recently presented Fast Lattice Shape Matching (FLSM), we compute the position of simulation nodes by convolution of rigid shape matching operators on many overlapping regions, but we rely instead on octree-based hierarchical sampling and an interval-based region definition. Our approach enjoys the efficiency and robustness of shape-matching deformation models, and the same algorithmic simplicity and linear cost as FLSM, but it eliminates its dense sampling requirements. Our method can handle adaptive spatial discretizations, allowing the simulation of more degrees of freedom in arbitrary regions of interest at little additional cost. The method is also versatile, as it can simulate elastic and plastic deformation, it can handle cuts interactively, and it reuses the underlying data structures for efficient handling of (self-)collisions. All this makes it especially useful for interactive applications such as videogames.

 Polyhedral Finite Elements Using Harmonic Basis Functions  ##   Finite element simulations in computer graphics are typically based on tetrahedral or hexahedral elements, which enables simple and efficient implementations, but in turn requires complicated remeshing in case of topological changes or adaptive refinement. We propose a flexible finite element method for arbitrary polyhedral elements, thereby effectively avoiding the need for remeshing. Our polyhedral finite elements are based on harmonic basis functions, which satisfy all necessary conditions for FEM simulations and seamlessly generalize both linear tetrahedral and trilinear hexahedral elements. We discretize harmonic basis functions using the method of fundamental solutions, which enables their flexible computation and efficient evaluation. The versatility of our approach is demonstrated on cutting and adaptive refinement within a simulation framework for corotated linear elasticity.

 Feedback Control of Cumuliform Cloud Formation Based on Computational Fluid Dynamics  ##   Clouds play an important role for creating realistic images of outdoor scenes. In order to generate realistic clouds, many methods have been developed for modeling and animating clouds. One of the most effective approaches for synthesizing realistic clouds is to simulate cloud formation processes based on the atmospheric fluid dynamics. Although this approach can create realistic clouds, the resulting shapes and motion depend on many simulation parameters and the initial status. Therefore, it is very difficult to adjust those parameters so that the clouds form the desired shapes. This paper addresses this problem and presents a method for controlling the simulation of cloud formation. In this paper, we focus on controlling cumuliform cloud formation. The user specifies the overall shape of the clouds. Then, our method automatically adjusts parameters during the simulation in order to generate clouds forming the specified shape. Our method can generate realistic clouds while their shapes closely match to the desired shape.

 Fool Me Twice: Exploring and Exploiting Error Tolerance in Physics-Based Animation  ##   The error tolerance of human perception offers a range of opportunities to trade numerical accuracy for performance in physics-based simulation. However, most previous approaches either focus exclusively on understanding the tolerance of the human visual system or burden the application developer with case-specific implementations. In this paper, based on a detailed set of perceptual metrics, we propose a methodology to identify the maximum error tolerance of physics simulation. Then, we apply this methodology in the evaluation of two techniques. The first is the hardware optimization technique of precision reduction which reduces the size of floating point units (FPUs), allowing more of them to occupy the same silicon area. The increased number of FPUs can significantly improve the performance of future physics accelerators. A key benefit of our approach is that it is transparent to the application developer. The second is the software optimization of choosing the largest timestep for simulation.

 Robust and Efficient Wave Simulations on Deforming Meshes  ##   The goal of this paper is to enable the interactive simulation of phenomena such as animated fluid characters. While full 3D fluid solvers achieve this with control algorithms, these 3D simulations are usually too costly for real-time environments. In order to achieve our goal, we reduce the problem from a three- to a two-dimensional one, and make use of the shallow water equations to simulate surface waves that can be solved very efficiently. In addition to a low runtime cost, stability is likewise crucial for interactive applications. Hence, we make use of an implicit time integration scheme to obtain a robust solver. To ensure a low energy dissipation, we apply an Implicit Newmark time integration scheme. We propose a general formulation of the underlying equations that is tailored towards the use with an Implicit Newmark integrator. Furthermore, we gain efficiency by making use of a direct solver. Due to the generality of our formulation, the fluid simulation can be coupled interactively with arbitrary external forces, such as forces caused by inertia or collisions. We will discuss the properties of our algorithm, and demonstrate its robustness with simulations on strongly deforming meshes.

 Cosserat Nets  ##   Cosserat nets are networks of elastic rods that are linked by elastic joints. They allow to represent a large variety of objects such as elastic rings, coarse nets, or truss structures. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to model and dynamically simulate such Cosserat nets. We first derive the static equilibrium of the elastic rod model that supports both bending and twisting deformation modes. We further propose a dynamic model that allows for the efficient simulation of elastic rods. We then focus on the simulation of the Cosserat nets by extending the elastic rod deformation model to branched and looped topologies. To round out the discussion, we evaluate our deformation model. By comparing our deformation model to a reference model, we illustrate both the physical plausibility and the conceptual advantages of the proposed approach.

 Thesis: Controlling Multibody Dynamics via Browsing and Time Reversal  ##   Christopher Twigg’s thesis from CMU: “Animation techniques for controlling passive simulation are commonly based on an optimization paradigm: the user provides goals a priori, and sophisticated numerical methods minimize a cost function that represents these goals. Unfortunately, for multibody systems with discontinuous contact events these optimization problems can be highly nontrivial to solve, and many-hour offline optimizations, unintuitive parameters, and convergence failures can frustrate end-users and limit usage. On the other hand, users are quite adaptable, and systems which provide interactive feedback via an intuitive interface can leverage the user’s own abilities to quickly produce interesting animations. However, the online computation necessary for interactivity limits scene complexity in practice. This thesis presents two methods for controlling the rigid body simulations. The first is Many-Worlds Browsing, a method which exploits the speed of multibody simulators to compute numerous simulations in parallel (offline and online), and allow the user to browse and modify them interactively. By bolting responsive, powerful, intuitive interfaces onto relatively simple sampling techniques we get a method that enables animators to produce compelling results with a minimum of effort. The second method is time-reversed simulation: we provide only the final resting configuration of the system and run the simulator backwards in time. During the development of this method we encountered a number of surprisingly counter-intuitive results, which can be elucidated using a combination of numerical simulation and thought experiments.” Controlling Multibody Dynamics via Browsing and Time Reversal  Controlling Multibody Dynamics via Browsing and Time Reversal http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cdtwigg/   ## August 27th, 2008  ##  Uncategorized   ##  http://www.physicsbasedanimation.com/2008/08/27/thesis-controlling-multibody-dynamics-via-browsing-and-time-reversal/

 Magnets in Motion  ##   We introduce magnetic interaction for rigid body simulation. Our approach is based on an equivalent dipole method and as such it is discrete from the ground up. Our approach is symmetric as we base both field and force computations on dipole interactions. Enriching rigid body simulation with magnetism allows for many new and interesting possibilities in computer animation and special effects. Our method also allows the accurate computation of magnetic fields for arbitrarily shaped objects, which is especially interesting for pedagogy as it allows the user to visually discover properties of magnetism which would otherwise be difficult to grasp. We demonstrate our method on a variety of problems and our results reflect intuitive as well as surprising effects. Our method is fast and can be coupled with any rigid body solver to simulate dozens of magnetic objects at interactive rates.

 Optimizing Cubature for Efficient Integration of Subspace Deformations  ##   We propose an efficient scheme for evaluating nonlinear subspace forces (and Jacobians) associated with subspace deformations. The core problem we address is efficient integration of the subspace force density over the 3D spatial domain. Similar to Gaussian quadrature schemes that efficiently integrate functions that lie in particular polynomial subspaces, we propose cubature schemes (multi-dimensional quadrature) optimized for efficient integration of force densities associated with particular subspace deformations, particular materials, and particular geometric domains. We support generic subspace deformation kinematics, and nonlinear hyperelastic materials. For an r-dimensional deformation subspace with O(r) cubature points, our method is able to evaluate subspace forces at O(r^2) cost. We also describe composite cubature rules for runtime error estimation. Results are provided for various subspace deformation models, several hyperelastic materials (St.Venant-Kirchhoff, Mooney-Rivlin, Arruda-Boyce), and multimodal (graphics, haptics, sound) applications. We show dramatically better efficiency than traditional Monte Carlo integration.

 Real-time Animation of Sand-Water Interaction  ##   Recent advances in physically-based simulations have made it possible to generate realistic animations. However, in the case of solid-fluid coupling, wetting effects have rarely been noticed despite their visual importance especially in interactions between fluids and granular materials. This paper presents a simple particle-based method to model the physical mechanism of wetness propagating through granular materials; Fluid particles are absorbed in the spaces between the granular particles and these wetted granular particles then stick together due to liquid bridges that are caused by surface tension and which will subsequently disappear when over-wetting occurs. Our method can handle these phenomena by introducing a wetness value for each granular particle and by integrating those aspects of behavior that are dependent on wetness into the simulation framework. Using this method, a GPU-based simulator can achieve highly dynamic animations that include wetting effects in real time.

 Vortex Methods for Incompressible Flow Simulation on the GPU  ##   We present a remeshed vortex particle method for incompressible flow simulations on GPUs. The particles are convected in a Lagrangian frame and are periodically reinitialized on a regular grid. The grid is used in addition to solve for the velocity–vorticity Poisson equation and for the computation of the diffusion operators. In the present GPU implementation of particle methods, the remeshing and the solution of the Poisson equation rely on fast and efficient mesh-particle interpolations. We demonstrate that particle remeshing introduces minimal artificial dissipation, enables a faster computation of differential operators on particles over grid-free techniques and can be efficiently implemented on GPUs. The results demonstrate that, contrary to common practice in particle simulations, it is necessary to remesh the (vortex) particle locations in order to solve accurately the equations they discretize, without compromising the speed of the method. The present method leads to simulations of incompressible vortical flows on GPUs with unprecedented accuracy and efficiency.

 Adaptive Particles for Incompressible Fluid Simulation  ##   We propose a particle-based technique for simulating incompressible fluid that includes adaptive refinement of particle sampling. Each particle represents a mass of fluid in its local region. Particles are split into several particles for finer sampling in regions of complex flow. In regions of smooth flow, neighboring particles can be merged. Depth below the surface and Reynolds number are exploited as our criteria for determining whether splitting or merging should take place. For the fluid dynamics calculations, we use the hybrid FLIP method, which is computationally simple and efficient. Since the fluid is incompressible, each particle has a volume proportional to its mass. A kernel function, whose effective range is based on this volume, is used for transferring and updating the particle’s physical properties such as mass and velocity. Our adaptive particle-based simulation is demonstrated in several scenarios that show its effectiveness in capturing fine detail of the flow, where needed, while efficiently sampling regions where less detail is required.

 Efficient Contact Modeling using Compliance Warping  ##   Precise contact modeling is essential when simulating rigid or deformable objects in interaction. Yet, most recent work in computer graphics has focused on the computation of the motion or deformation of objects, and little has been done to model the interaction between simulated objects. In this paper, we propose a novel and very efficient approach for precise computation of contact response between various types of objects commonly used in computer animation. Our approach represents the objects motion as a free motion and a corrective motion. The corrective motion uses an efficient contact model, based on an approximation of the behavior model, but still follows Signorini and Coulomb laws for contact and friction modeling. Our approach guarantees no interpenetration at the end of the time step, and only introduces a minimal error in the objects motion. We illustrate our approach using an approximate (warped) compliance in the case of non-linear deformable models. This speeds-up the contact response by several orders of magnitude, thus allowing the simulation of scenes with many complex interacting objects.

 Staggered Projections for Frictional Contact in Multibody Systems  ##   We present a new discrete velocity-level formulation of frictional contact dynamics that reduces to a pair of coupled projections and introduce a simple fixed-point property of this coupled system. This allows us to construct a novel algorithm for accurate frictional contact resolution based on a simple staggered sequence of projections. The algorithm accelerates performance using warm starts to leverage the potentially high temporal coherence between contact states and provides users with direct control over frictional accuracy. Applying this algorithm to rigid and deformable systems, we obtain robust and accurate simulations of frictional contact behavior not previously possible, at rates suitable for interactive haptic simulations, as well as large-scale animations. By construction, the proposed algorithm guarantees exact, velocity-level contact constraint enforcement and obtains long-term stable and robust integration. Examples are given to illustrate the performance, plausibility and accuracy of the obtained solutions.

 Real-Time Control of Physically Based Simulations Using Gentle Forces  ##   Recent advances have brought real-time physically based simulation within reach, but simulations are still difficult to control in real time. We present interactive simulations of passive systems such as deformable solids or fluids that are not only fast, but also directable: they follow given input trajectories while simultaneously reacting to user input and other unexpected disturbances. We achieve such directability using a real-time controller that runs in tandem with a real-time physically based simulation. To avoid stiff and overcontrolled systems where the natural dynamics are overpowered, the injection of control forces has to be minimized. This search for gentle forces can be made tractable in real-time by linearizing the system dynamics around the input trajectory, and then using a time-varying linear quadratic regulator to build the controller. We show examples of controlled complex deformable solids and fluids, demonstrating that our approach generates a requested fixed outcome for reasonable user inputs, while simultaneously providing runtime motion variety.

 Hierarchical Position Based Dynamics  ##   The Position Based Dynamics approach (PBD) recently introduced allows robust simulations of dynamic systems in real time. The simplicity of the method is due to the fact, that the solver processes the constraints one by one in a Gauss-Seidel type manner. In contrast to global Newton-Raphson solvers, the local solver can easily handle non-linear constraints as well as constraints based on inequalities. Unfortunately, this advantage comes at the price of much slower convergence.  In this paper we propose a multi-grid based process to speed up the convergence of PBD significantly while keeping the power of the method to process general non-linear constraints. Several examples show that the new approach is significantly faster than the original one. This makes real time simulation possible at a higher level of detail in interactive applications such as computer games.

 Corotated Finite Elements Made Fast and Stable  ##   Multigrid finite-element solvers using the corotational formulation of finite elements provide an attractive means for the simulation of deformable bodies exhibiting linear elastic response. The separation of rigid body motions from the total element motions using purely geometric methods or polar decomposition of the deformation gradient, however, can introduce instabilities for large element rotations and deformations. Furthermore, the integration of the corotational formulation into dynamic multigrid elasticity simulations requires to continually rebuild consistent system matrices at different resolution levels. The computational load imposed by these updates prohibits the use of large numbers of finite elements at rates comparable to the small-strain finite element formulation. To overcome the first problem, we present a new method to extract the rigid body motion from total finite element displacements based on energy minimization. This results in a very stable corotational formulation that only slightly increases the computational overhead. We address the second problem by introducing a novel algorithm for computing sparse products of the form RKRT, as they have to be evaluated to update the multigrid hierarchy. By reformulating the problem into the simultaneous processing of a sequential data and control stream, cache miss penalties are significantly reduced. Even though the algorithm increases memory requirements, it accelerates the multigrid FE simulation by a factor of up to 4 compared to previous multigrid approaches. Due to the proposed improvements, finite element deformable body simulations using the corotational formulation can be performed at rates of 17 tps for up to 12k elements.

 Seams and Bending in Cloth Simulation  ##   Accurate  		modeling of bending behavior is one of the most important tasks in the  		field of cloth simulation. Bending stiffness is probably the most  		significant material parameter describing a given textile. Much work has  		been done in recent years to allow a fast and authentic reproduction of  		the effect of bending in cloth simulation systems. However, these  		approaches usually treat the textiles as consisting of a single,  		homogeneous material. The effects of seams, interlining and multilayer  		materials have not been considered so far. Recent work showed that the  		bending stiffness of a textile is greatly influenced by the presence of  		seams and that a good cloth simulation system needs to consider these  		effects. In this work we show how accurate modeling of bending and seams can be  		achieved in a state-of-the-art cloth simulation system. Our system can  		make use of measured bending stiffness data, but also allows intuitive  		user control, if desired. We verify our approach using virtual draping  		tests and garments in the simulation and comparing the results to their  		real-world counterparts. Furthermore, we provide heuristics derived from  		measurements that can be used to approximate the influence of several  		common types of seams.

 A Geometric Deformation Model for Stable Cloth Simulation  ##   We propose an adapted shape-matching approach for the efficient and robust simulation of clothing. A combination of two different cluster types is employed to account for high stretching and shearing, and low bending resistance. Due to the inherent handling of overshooting issues, the proposed shape-matching deformation model is robust. The proposed cluster types allow for a computationally efficient handling of bending. The geometric deformation model is combined with a novel collision handling approach. The technique employs spatial subdivision to detect collisions and self-collisions. The response scheme is derived from an existing approach for elastic rods. To illustrate the physically plausible dynamics of our approach, it is compared to a traditional physically-based deformation model. Experiments indicate that similar cloth properties can be reproduced with both models. The computational efficiency of the proposed scheme enables the interactive animation of clothing and shells.

 Parallel Simulation of Inextensible Cloth  ##   This paper presents an efficient simulation method for parallel cloth simulation. The presented method uses an impulse-based approach for the simulation. Cloth simulation has many application areas like computer animation, computer games or virtual reality. Simulation methods often make the assumption that cloth is an elastic material. In this way the simulation can be performed very efficiently by using spring forces. These methods disregard the fact that many textiles cannot be stretched significantly. The simulation of inextensible textiles with methods based on spring forces leads to stiff differential equations which cause a loss of performance. In contrast to that, in this paper a method is presented that simulates cloth by using impulses. The mesh of a cloth model is subdivided into strips of constraints. The impulses for each strip can be computed in linear time. The strips that have no common particle are independent from each other and can be solved in parallel. The impulse-based method allows the realistic simulation of inextensible textiles in real-time.

 Hydraulic Erosion Using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics  ##   This paper presents a new technique for modification of 3D terrains by hydraulic erosion. It efficiently couples fluid simulation using a Lagrangian approach, namely the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method, and a physically-based erosion model adopted from an Eulerian approach. The eroded sediment is associated with the SPH particles and is advected both implicitly, due to the particle motion, and explicitly, through an additional velocity field, which accounts for the sediment transfer between the particles. We propose a new donor-acceptor scheme for the explicit advection in SPH. Boundary particles associated to the terrain are used to mediate sediment exchange between the SPH particles and the terrain itself. Our results show that this particle-based method is efficient for the erosion of dense, large, and sparse fluid. Our implementation provides interactive results for scenes with up to 25,000 particles.

 Scalable Real-Time Animation of Rivers  ##   Many recent games and applications target the interactive exploration of realistic large scale worlds. These worlds consist mostly of static terrain models, as the simulation of animated fluids in these virtual worlds is computation- ally expensive. Adding flowing fluids, such as rivers, to these virtual worlds would greatly enhance their realism, but causes specific issues: as the user is usually observing the world at close range, small scale details such as waves and ripples are important. However, the large scale of the world makes classical methods impractical for simulating these effects. In this paper, we present an algorithm for the interactive simulation of realistic flowing fluids in large virtual worlds. Our method relies on two key contributions: the local computation of the velocity field of a steady flow given boundary conditions, and the advection of small scale details on a fluid, following the velocity field, and uniformly sampled in screen space.

 Mixing Fluids and Granular Materials  ##   Fluid animations in computer graphics show interactions with various kinds of objects. However, fluid flowing through a granular material such as sand is still not possible within current frameworks. In this paper, we present the simulation of fine granular materials interacting with fluids. We propose a unified Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics framework for the simulation of both fluid and granular material. The granular volume is simulated as a continuous material sampled by particles. By incorporating previous work on porous flow in this simulation framework we are able to fully couple fluid and sand. Fluid can now percolate between sand grains and influence the physical properties of the sand volume. Our method demonstrates various new effects such as dry soil transforming into mud pools by rain or rigid sand structures being eroded by waves.

 Implicit Contact Handling for Deformable Objects  ##   We present an algorithm for robust and efficient contact handling of deformable objects. By being aware of the internal dynamics of the colliding objects, our algorithm provides smooth rolling and sliding, stable stacking, robust impact handling, and seamless coupling of heterogeneous objects, all in a unified manner. We achieve dynamicsawareness through a constrained dynamics formulation with implicit complementarity constraints, and we present two major contributions that enable an efficient solution of the constrained dynamics problem: a time stepping algorithm that robustly ensures non-penetration and progressively refines the formulation of constrained dynamics, and a new solver for large mixed linear complementarity problems, based on iterative constraint anticipation. We show the application of our algorithm in challenging scenarios such as multi-layered cloth moving at high velocities, or colliding deformable solids simulated with large time steps.

 Real-Time Fluid Simulation Using Discrete Sine/Cosine Transforms  ##   Recent advances in fluid simulations have yielded exceptionally realistic imagery. However, most algorithms have computational requirements that are prohibitive for real-time simulations. Using Fourier based solutions mitigates this issue, although due to wraparound, boundary conditions are not naturally available, leading to inconsistencies near the boundary. We show that slip boundary conditions can be imposed by solving the mass conservation step using cosine and sine transforms instead of the Fourier transform. Further, we show that measures against density dissipation can be computed using cosine transforms and we describe a new method to compute surface tension in the same domain. This combination of related algorithms leads to real-time simulations with boundary conditions.

 Simulation of Two-Phase Flow with Sub-Scale Droplets and Bubble Effects  ##   We present a new Eulerian-Lagrangian method for physics-based simulation of fluid flow, which includes automatic generation of sub-scale spray and bubbles. The Marker Level Set method is used to provide a simple geometric criterion for free marker generation. A filtering method, inspired from Weber number thresholding, further controls the free marker generation (in a physics-based manner). Two separate models are used, one for sub-scale droplets, the other for sub-scale bubbles. Droplets are evolved in a Newtonian manner, using a density extension drag force field, while bubbles are evolved using a model based on Stokes’ Law. We show that our model for sub-scale droplet and bubble dynamics is simple to couple with a full (macro-scale) Navier-Stokes two-phase flow model and is quite powerful in its applications. Our animations include coarse grained multiphase features interacting with fine scale multiphase features.

 Continuum-based Strain Limiting  ##   We present Continuum-based Strain Limiting (CSL)  		– a new method for limiting deformations in physically-based cloth  		simulations. Recent developments have led to methods which excel at  		simulating nearly inextensible materials, but the efficient simulation  		of general biphasic textiles and their anisotropic behavior remains  		challenging. Other approaches use softer materials and enforce limits on  		edge elongations, leading to discretization-dependent behavior.  		Moreover, they offer no explicit control over shearing and stretching  		unless specifically aligned meshes are used, which makes them less  		attractive for practical animation of anisotropic textiles. Based on a  		continuum deformation measure, our method allows accurate deformation  		control using individual thresholds for all types of strain. We impose  		deformation limits element-wise and cast the problem as a system of  		linear equations. We show how to further improve efficiency using an  		approximate formulation. CSL can be combined with any type of cloth  		simulator and, as a velocity filter, integrates seamlessly into standard  		collision handling frameworks.

 Linear Time Super-Helices  ##   Thin elastic rods such as cables, phone coils, tree branches, or hair, are common objects in the real world but computing their dynamics accurately remains challenging. The recent Super-Helix model, based on the discrete equations of Kirchhoff for a piecewise helical rod, is one of the most promising models for simulating non-stretchable rods that can bend and twist. However, this model suffers from a quadratic complexity in the number of discrete elements, which, in the context of interactive applications, makes it limited to a few number of degrees of freedom – or equivalently to a low number of variations in curvature along the mean curve. This paper proposes a new, recursive scheme for the dynamics of a Super-Helix, inspired by the popular algorithm of Featherstone for serial multibody chains. Similarly to Featherstone’s algorithm, we exploit the recursive kinematics of a Super-Helix to propagate elements inertias from the free end to the clamped end of the rod, while the dynamics is solved within a second pass traversing the rod in the reverse way. Besides the gain in linear complexity, which allows us to simulate a rod of complex shape much faster than the original approach, our algorithm makes it straightforward to simulate tree-like structures of Super-Helices, which turns out to be particularly useful for animating trees and plants realistically, under large displacements.

 Lie Group Integrators for Animation and Control of Vehicles  ##   This paper is concerned with the animation and control of vehicles with complex dynamics such as helicopters, boats, and cars. Motivated by recent developments in discrete geometric mechanics we develop a general framework for integrating the dynamics of holonomic and nonholonomic vehicles by preserving their state-space geometry and motion invariants. We demonstrate that the resulting integration schemes are superior to standard methods in numerical robustness and efficiency, and can be applied to many types of vehicles. In addition, we show how to use this framework in an optimal control setting to automatically compute accurate and realistic motions for arbitrary user-specified constraints.

 An Edge-Based Computationally Efficient Formulation of Saint-Venant Kirchhoff Tetrahedral Finite Elements  ##   This article describes a computationally efficient formulation and an algorithm for tetrahedral finite-element simulation of elastic objects subject to Saint Venant-Kirchhoff (StVK) material law. The number of floating point operations required by the algorithm is in the range of 15% to 27% for computing the vertex forces from a given set of vertex positions, and 27% to 38% for the tangent stiffness matrix, in comparison to a well-optimized algorithm directly derived from the conventional Total Lagrangian formulation. In the new algorithm, the data is associated with edges and tetrahedron-sharing edge-pairs (TSEPs), as opposed to tetrahedra, to avoid redundant computation. Another characteristic of the presented formulation is that it reduces to that of a spring-network model by simply ignoring all the TSEPs. The technique is demonstrated through an interactive application involving haptic interaction, being combined with a linearized implicit integration technique employing a preconditioned conjugate gradient method.

 Triangular Springs for Modeling Nonlinear Membranes  ##   This paper provides a formal connexion between springs and continuum mechanics in the context of onedimensional and two-dimensional elasticity. In a first stage, the equivalence between tensile springs and the finite element discretization of stretching energy on planar curves is established. Furthermore, when considering a quadratic strain function of stretch, we introduce a new type of springs called tensile biquadratic springs. In a second stage, we extend this equivalence to non-linear membranes (St Venant-Kirchhoff materials) on triangular meshes leading to triangular biquadratic and quadratic springs. Those tensile and angular springs produce isotropic deformations parameterized by Young modulus and Poisson ratios on unstructured meshes in an efficient and simple way. For a specific choice of the Poisson ratio, 0.3, we show that regular spring-mass models may be used realistically to simulate a membrane behavior. Finally, the different spring formulations are tested in pure traction and cloth simulation experiments.

 Co-rotated SPH for Deformable Solids  ##   Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) is a powerful technique for the animation of natural phenomena. While early SPH approaches in Computer Graphics have mainly been concerned with liquids or gases, recent research also focuses on the dynamics of deformable solids using SPH. In this paper, we present a novel corotational SPH formulation for deformable solids. The rigid body modes are extracted from the deformation field which allows to use a linear strain tensor. In contrast to previous rotationally invariant meshless approaches, we show examples using coplanar and collinear particle data sets. The presented approach further allows for a unified meshfree representation of deformable solids and fluids. This enables the animation of sophisticated phenomena, such as phase transitions. The versatility and the efficiency of the presented SPH scheme for deformable solids is illustrated in various experiments.

 Energy-Preserving Integrators for Fluid Animation  ##   Numerical viscosity has long been a problem in fluid animation. Existing methods suffer from intrinsic artificial dissipation and often apply complicated computational mechanisms to combat such effects. Consequently, dissipative behavior cannot be controlled or modeled explicitly in a manner independent of time step size, complicating the use of coarse previews and adaptive-time stepping methods. This paper proposes simple, unconditionally stable, fully Eulerian integration schemes with no numerical viscosity that are capable of maintaining the liveliness of fluid motion without recourse to corrective devices. Pressure and fluxes are solved efficiently and simultaneously in a time-reversible manner on simplicial grids, and the energy is preserved exactly over long time scales in the case of inviscid fluids. These integrators can be viewed as an extension of the classical energy-preserving Harlow-Welch / Crank-Nicolson scheme to simplicial grids.

 Numerical Coarsening of Inhomogeneous Elastic Materials  ##   We propose an approach for efficiently simulating elastic objects made of non-homogeneous, non-isotropic materials. Based on recent developments in homogenization theory, a methodology is introduced to approximate a deformable object made of arbitrary fine structures of various linear elastic materials with a dynamically-similar coarse model. This coarsening of the material properties allows for simulation of fine, heterogeneous structures on very coarse grids while capturing the proper dynamics of the original dynamical system, thus saving orders of magnitude in computational time. Examples including inhomogeneous and/or anisotropic materials can be realistically simulated in realtime using a numerically-coarsened model made of a few mesh elements.

 Preserving Topology and Elasticity for Embedded Deformable Models  ##   In this paper we introduce a new approach for the embedding of linear elastic deformable models. Our technique results in significant improvements in the efficient physically based simulation of highly detailed objects. First, our embedding takes into account topological details, that is, disconnected parts that fall into the same coarse element are simulated independently. Second, we account for the varying material properties by computing stiffness and interpolation functions for coarse elements which accurately approximate the behavior of the embedded material. Finally, we also take into account empty space in the coarse embeddings, which provides a better simulation of the boundary. The result is a straightforward approach to simulating complex deformable models with the ease and speed associated with a coarse regular embedding, and with a quality of detail that would only be possible at much finer resolution.

 Deformable Object Animation Using Reduced Optimal Control  ##   Keyframe animation is a common technique to generate animations of deformable characters and other soft bodies. With spline interpolation, however, it can be difficult to achieve secondary motion effects such as plausible dynamics when there are thousands of degrees of freedom to animate. Physical methods can provide more realism with less user effort, but it is challenging to apply them to quickly create specific animations that closely follow prescribed animator goals. We present a fast space-time optimization method  to author physically based deformable object  simulations that conform to animator-specified keyframes. We demonstrate our method with FEM deformable objects and mass-spring systems.  Our method minimizes an objective function that penalizes the sum of keyframe deviations plus the deviation of the trajectory from physics. With existing methods, such minimizations operate in high dimensions, are slow, memory consuming, and prone to local minima. We demonstrate that significant computational speedups and robustness improvements can be achieved if the optimization problem is properly solved in a low-dimensional space. Selecting a low-dimensional space so that the intent of the animator is accommodated, and that at the same time space-time optimization is convergent and fast, is difficult. We present a method that generates a quality low-dimensional space using the given keyframes. It is then possible to find quality solutions to difficult space-time optimization problems robustly and in a manner of minutes.

 Deforming Meshes that Split and Merge  ##   We present a method for accurately tracking the moving surface of deformable materials in a manner that gracefully handles topological changes.We employ a Lagrangian surface tracking method, and we use a triangle mesh for our surface representation so that fine features can be retained. We make topological changes to the mesh by first identifying merging or splitting events at a particular grid resolution, and then locally creating new pieces of the mesh in the affected cells using a standard isosurface creation method.We stitch the new, topologically simplified portion of the mesh to the rest of the mesh at the cell boundaries. Our method detects and treats topological events with an emphasis on the preservation of detailed features, while simultaneously simplifying those portions of the material that are not visible. Our surface tracker is not tied to a particular method for simulating deformable materials. In particular, we show results from two significantly different simulators: a Lagrangian FEM simulator with tetrahedral elements, and an Eulerian grid-based fluid simulator. Although our surface tracking method is generic, it is particularly well-suited for simulations that exhibit fine surface details and numerous topological events. Highlights of our results include merging of viscoplastic materials with complex geometry, a taffy-pulling animation with many fold and merge events, and stretching and slicing of stiff plastic material.

 Interactive Simulation of Surgical Needle Insertion and Steering  ##   We present algorithms for simulating and visualizing the insertion  and steering of needles through deformable tissues for surgical  training and planning. Needle insertion is an essential component  of manyclinical procedures such as biopsies, injections, neurosurgery,  and brachytherapy cancer treatment. The success of these  procedures dependson accurate guidanceofthe needletiptoaclinical  target while avoiding vital tissues. Needle insertion deforms  body tissues, making accurate placement difficult. Our interactive  needle insertion simulator models the coupling between a steerable  needle and deformable tissue.

 Modular Bases for Fluid Dynamics  ##   We present a new approach to ﬂuid simulation that balances the speed of model reduction with the ﬂexibility of grid-based methods. We construct a set of composable reduced models, or tiles, which capture spatially localized ﬂuid behavior. We then precompute coupling terms so that these models can be rearranged at runtime. To enforce consistency between tiles, we introduce constraint reduction. This technique modiﬁes a reduced model so that a given set of linear constraints can be fulﬁlled. Because dynamics and constraints can be solved entirely in the reduced space, our method is extremely fast and scales to large domains.

 Predictive-Corrective Incompressible SPH  ##   We present a novel, incompressible fluid simulation method based on the Lagrangian Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) model. In our method, incompressibility is enforced by using a prediction-correction scheme to determine the particle pressures. For this, the information about density fluctuations is actively propagated through the fluid and pressure values are updated until the targeted density is satisfied. With this approach, we avoid the computational expenses of solving a pressure Poisson equation, while still being able to use large time steps in the simulation. The achieved results show that our predictive-corrective incompressible SPH (PCISPH) method clearly outperforms the commonly used weakly compressible SPH (WCSPH) model by more than an order of magnitude while the computations are in good agreement with the WCSPH results.

Instead of refining or remeshing the underlying simulation domain to resolve complex cut paths, we adapt the extended finite element method (XFEM) and enrich our approximation by custom designed basis functions, while keeping the simulation mesh unchanged. The enrichment functions are stored in enrichment textures, which allows for fracture and cutting discontinuities at a resolution much finer than the underlying mesh, similar to image textures for increased visual resolution. Furthermore, we propose harmonic enrichment functions to handle multiple, intersecting, arbitrarily shaped, progressive cuts per element in a simple and unified framework. Our underlying shell simulation is based on discontinuous Galerkin (DG) FEM, which relaxes the restrictive requirement of C1 continuous basis functions and thus allows for simpler, C0 continuous XFEM enrichment functions.

 Capture and Modeling of Non-Linear Heterogeneous Soft Tissue  ##   This paper introduces a data-driven representation and modeling technique for simulating non-linear heterogeneous soft tissue. It simplifies the construction of convincing deformable models by avoiding complex selection and tuning of physical material parameters, yet retaining the richness of non-linear heterogeneous behavior. We acquire a set of example deformations of a real object, and represent each of them as a spatially varying stress-strain relationship in a finite-element model. We then model the material by non-linear interpolation of these stress-strain relationships in strain-space. Our method relies on a simple-to-build capture system and an efficient run-time simulation algorithm based on incremental loading, making it suitable for interactive computer graphics applications. We present the results of our approach for several nonlinear materials and biological soft tissue, with accurate agreement of our model to the measured data.

 Asynchronous Contact Mechanics  ##   We develop a method for reliable simulation of elastica in complex contact scenarios. Our focus is on firmly establishing three parameter-independent guarantees: that simulations of well-posed problems (a) have no interpenetrations, (b) obey causality, momentum- and energy-conservation laws, and (c) complete in finite time. We achieve these guarantees through a novel synthesis of asynchronous variational integrators, kinetic data structures, and a discretization of the contact barrier potential by an infinite sum of nested quadratic potentials. In a series of two- and three-dimensional examples, we illustrate that this method more easily handles challenging problems involving complex contact geometries, sharp features, and sliding during extremely tight contact.

 Interleaving Delaunay Refinement and Optimization for Practical Isotropic Tetrahedron Mesh Generation  ##   We present a practical approach to isotropic tetrahedral meshing of 3D domains bounded by piecewise smooth surfaces. Building upon recent theoretical and practical advances, our algorithm interleaves Delaunay refinement and mesh optimization to generate quality meshes that satisfy a set of user-defined criteria. This interleaving is shown to be more conservative in number of Steiner point insertions than refinement alone, and to produce higher quality meshes than optimization alone. A careful treatment of boundaries and their features is presented, offering a versatile framework for designing smoothly graded tetrahedral meshes.

 Simple, yet accurate tensile stiffness  ##   Recent Particle System models have evolved toward accurate representation of elastic stiffness based on continuum mechanics, converging to formulations that make them quite analogous to fast Finite Element methods. These formulations usually involve the linearization of tensors that help their formulation in the context of linear elasticity. Toward our objective of simulating the nonlinear properties of cloth accurately, we show through this work that this linearization can indeed be suppressed and replaced by adapted strain-stress laws relating precisely the nonlinear behavior of the material. This leads to very streamlined computations that are particularly efficient for simulating the nonlinear anisotropic tensile elasticity of deformable surfaces. Through a simple and efficient implementation using the Particle System formalism, we demonstrate the efficiency of this method with examples related to garment simulation.

 A Point-based Method for Animating Incompressible Flow  ##   In this paper, we present a point-based method for animating incompressible flow. The advection term is handled by moving the sample points through the flow in a Lagrangian fashion. However, unlike most previous approaches, the pressure term is handled by performing a projection onto a divergence-free field. To perform the pressure projection, we compute a Voronoi  diagram with the sample points as input. Borrowing from Finite Volume Methods, we then invoke the divergence theorem and ensure that each Voronoi cell is divergence free. To handle complex boundary conditions, Voronoi cells are clipped against obstacle boundaries and free surfaces. The method is stable, flexible and combines many of the desirable features of point-based and grid-based methods. We demonstrate our approach on several examples of splashing and streaming liquid and swirling smoke.

 A Point-based Method for Animating Elastoplastic Solids  ##   In this paper we describe a point-based approach for animating elastoplastic materials. Our primary contribution is a simple method for computing the deformation gradient for each particle in the simulation. The deformation gradient is computed for each particle by finding the affine transformation that best approximates the motion of neighboring particles over a single timestep. These transformations are then composed to compute the total deformation gradient that describes the deformation around a particle over the course of the simulation. Given the deformation gradient we can apply arbitrary constitutive models and compute the resulting elastic forces. Our method has two primary advantages: we do not store or compare to an initial rest configuration and we work directly with the deformation gradient. The first advantage avoids poor numerical conditioning and the second naturally leads to a multiplicative model of deformation appropriate for finite deformations. We demonstrate our approach on a number of examples that exhibit a wide range of material behaviors.

 Real-Time Deformation and Fracture in a Game Environment  ##   This paper describes a simulation system that has been developed to   model the deformation and fracture of solid objects in a real-time   gaming context.  Based around a corotational tetrahedral finite   element method, this system has been constructed from components   published in the graphics and computational physics literatures.  The   goal of this paper is to describe how these components can   be combined to produce an engine that is robust to unpredictable   user interactions, fast enough to model reasonable scenarios at   real-time speeds, suitable for use in the design of a game level,   and with appropriate controls allowing content creators to match   artistic direction.  Details concerning parallel implementation,   solver design, rendering method, and other aspects of the simulation   are elucidated with the intent of providing a guide to others wishing   to implement similar systems.

 Fast and Robust Tracking of Fluid Surfaces  ##   Surface tracking is an important problem with applications in many research fields. Among the most famous examples in computer graphics is the simulation and rendering of liquids with free surfaces. A surface that is advected by a general velocity field constantly changes its topology. This is the main reason why moving surfaces are typically defined implicitly as the zero set of a scalar field rather than by an explicit representation such as a mesh for instance. In this paper we present a method for tracking fluid surfaces using triangle meshes. This is done in two steps. First, the vertices are advected by the velocity field of the fluid. Second, self-penetrations are fixed using marching cubes triangle templates. The technique is efficient in terms of computation and memory consumption, it is simple to implement and allows for direct control of volume and feature preservation.

 Guiding of Smoke Animations Through Variational Coupling of Simulations at Different Resolutions  ##   We propose a novel   approach to guiding of Eulerian-based smoke animations through coupling of   simulations at different grid resolutions. Specifically we present a   variational formulation that allows smoke animations to adopt the   low-frequency features from a lower resolution simulation (or non-physical synthesis),   while simultaneously developing higher frequencies. The overall motivation   for this work is to address the fact that art-direction of smoke animations   is notoriously tedious. Particularly a change in grid resolution can result   in dramatic changes in the behavior of smoke animations, and existing methods   for guiding either significantly lack high frequency detail or may result in   undesired features developing over time. Provided that the bulk movement can   be represented satisfactorily at low resolution, our technique effectively   allows artists to prototype simulations at low resolution (where computations   are fast) and subsequently add extra details without altering the overall   “look and feel”. Our implementation is based on a customized multi-grid solver   with memory-efficient data structures.

 Accurate Tangential Velocities for Solid-Fluid Coupling  ##   We propose a novel method for obtaining more accurate tangential velocities for solid fluid coupling. Our method works for both rigid and deformable objects as well as both volumetric objects and thin shells. The fluid can be either one phase such as smoke or two phase such as water with a free surface. The coupling between the solid and the fluid can either be one-way with kinematic solids or fully two-way coupled. The only previous scheme that was general enough to handle both two-way coupling and thin shells required a mass lumping strategy that did not allow for freely flowing tangential velocities. Similar to that previous work, our method prevents leaking of fluid across a thin shell, however unlike that work our method does not couple the tangential velocities in any fashion, allowing for the proper slip independently on each side of the body. Moreover, since it accurately and directly treats the tangential velocity, it does not rely on grid refinement to obtain a reasonable solution. Therefore, it gives a highly improved result on coarse meshes.

 Anisotropic Friction for Deformable Surfaces and Solids  ##   This paper presents a method for simulating  		anisotropic friction for deforming surfaces and solids. Frictional  		contact is a complex phenomenon that fuels research in mechanical  		engineering, computational contact mechanics, composite material design  		and rigid body dynamics, to name just a few. Many real-world materials  		have anisotropic surface properties. As an example, most textile  		materials exhibit direction-dependent frictional behavior, but despite  		its tremendous impact on visual appearance, only simple isotropic models  		have been considered for cloth and solid simulation so far. In this work, we propose a simple, application-oriented but physically  		sound model that extends existing methods to account for anisotropic  		friction. The sliding properties of surfaces are encoded in friction tensors,  		which allows us to model frictional resistance freely along arbitrary  		directions. We also consider heterogeneous and asymmetric surface  		roughness and demonstrate the increased simulation quality on a number  		of two- and three-dimensional examples. Our method is computationally  		efficient and can easily be integrated into existing systems.

 Fluid Simulation with Articulated Bodies  ##   We present an algorithm for creating realistic animations of characters     that are swimming through fluids. Our approach combines dynamic simulation     with data-driven kinematic motions (motion capture data) to produce     realistic animation in a fluid.  The interaction of the articulated body     with the fluid is performed by incorporating joint constraints with rigid     animation and by extending a solid/fluid coupling method to handle     articulated chains.  Our solver takes as input the current state of the     simulation and calculates the angular and linear accelerations of the     connected bodies needed to match a particular motion sequence for the     articulated body.  These accelerations are used to estimate the forces and     torques that are then applied to each joint.  Based on this approach, we     demonstrate simulated swimming results for a variety of different strokes,     including crawl, backstroke, breaststroke and butterfly.  The ability to     have articulated bodies interact with fluids also allows us to generate     simulations of simple water creatures that are driven by simple     controllers.

 Statistical Simulation of Rigid Bodies  ##   We describe a method for replacing certain stages of rigid body simulation with a statistically-based approximation. We begin by collecting statistical data regarding changes in linear and angular momentum for collisions of a given object. From this data we extract a statistical “signature” for the object, giving a compact representation of the object’s response to collision events. During object simulation, both the collision detection and the collision response calculations are replaced by simpler calculations based on the statistical signature. Using this approach, we are able to achieve significant improvement in the performance of rigid body simulation. The statistical behavior of the simulation is maintained, including achieving valid resting positions. We present results from a variety of simulations that demonstrate the method and its performance improvement. The method is appropriate for rigid body simulation situations requiring significant performance improvement, and allowing for some loss in fidelity Statistical Simulation of Rigid Bodies  Statistical Simulation of Rigid Bodies http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/keyser/papers.html   ## August 18th, 2009  ##  Rigid bodies   ##  http://www.physicsbasedanimation.com/2009/08/18/statistical-simulation-of-rigid-bodies/

 Stretching and Wiggling Liquids  ##   This paper presents a novel framework for simulating the stretching and wiggling of liquids. We demonstrate that complex phase-interface dynamics can be effectively simulated by introducing the Eulerian vortex sheet method, which focuses on the vorticity at the interface (rather than the whole domain). We extend this model to provide user control for the production of visual effects. Then, the generated fluid flow creates complex surface details, such as thin and wiggling fluid sheets. To capture such high-frequency features efficiently, this work employs a denser grid for surface tracking in addition to the (coarser) simulation grid. In this context, the paper proposes a filter, called the liquid-biased filter, which is able to downsample the surface in the high-resolution grid into the coarse grid without unrealistic volume loss resulting from aliasing error. The proposed method, which runs on a single PC, realistically reproduces complex fluid scenes.

 Motion Field Texture Synthesis  ##   A variety of animation effects such as herds and fluids contain detailed motion fields characterized by repetitive structures. Such detailed motion fields are often visually important, but tedious to specify manually or expensive to simulate computationally. Due to the repetitive nature, some of these motion fields (e.g. turbulence in fluids) could be synthesized by procedural texturing, but procedural texturing is known for its limited generality. We apply example-based texture synthesis for motion fields. Our technique is general and can take on a variety of user inputs, including captured data, manual art, and physical/procedural simulation. This data-driven approach enables artistic effects that are difficult to achieve via previous methods, such as heart shaped swirls in fluid animation. Due to the use of texture synthesis, our method is able to populate a large output field from a small input exemplar, imposing minimum user workload. Our algorithm also allows the synthesis of output motion fields not only with the same dimension as the input (e.g. 2D to 2D) but also of higher dimension, such as 3D volumetric outputs from 2D planar inputs. This cross-dimension capability supports a convenient usage scenario, i.e. the user could simply supply 2D images and our method produces a 3D motion field with similar characteristics. The motion fields produced by our method are generic, and could be combined with a variety of large-scale low-resolution motions that are easy to specify either manually or computationally but lack the repetitive structures to be characterized as textures. We apply our technique to a variety of animation phenomena, including smoke, liquid, and group motion.

 Synthetic Turbulence using Artificial Boundary Layers  ##   Turbulent vortices in fluid flows are crucial for a visually interesting appearance.  Although there has been a significant amount of work on turbulence in graphics recently, these algorithms rely on the underlying simulation to resolve the flow around objects.  We build upon work from classical fluid mechanics to design an algorithm that allows us to accurately precompute the turbulence being generated around an object immersed in a flow. This is made possible by modeling turbulence formation based on an averaged flow field, and relying on universal laws describing the flow near a wall. We precompute the confined vorticity in the boundary layer around an object, and simulate the boundary layer separation during a fluid simulation. Then, a turbulence model is used to identify areas where this separated layer will transition into actual turbulence.  We sample these regions with vortex particles, and simulate the further dynamics of the vortices based on these particles.  We will show how our method complements previous work on synthetic turbulence, and yields physically plausible results.  In addition, we demonstrate that our method can efficiently compute turbulent flows around a variety of objects including cars, whisks, as well as boulders in a river flow.  We can even apply our model to precomputed static flow fields, yielding turbulent dynamics without a costly simulation.

 Skipping Steps in Deformable Simulation with Online Model Reduction  ##   Finite element simulations of nonlinear deformable models are computationally costly, routinely taking hours or days to compute the motion of detailed meshes. Dimensional model reduction can make simulations orders of magnitude faster, but is unsuitable for general deformable body simulations because it requires expensive precomputations, and it can suppress motion that lies outside the span of a pre-specified low-rank basis. We present an online model reduction method that does not have these limitations. In lieu of precomputation, we analyze the motion of the full model as the simulation progresses, incrementally building a reduced-order nonlinear model, and detecting when our reduced model is capable of performing the next timestep. For these subspace steps, full-model computation is “skipped” and replaced with a very fast (on the order of milliseconds) reduced order step. We present algorithms for both dynamic and quasistatic simulations, and a “throttle” parameter that allows a user to trade off between faster, approximate previews and slower, more conservative results. For detailed meshes undergoing low-rank motion, we have observed speedups of over an order of magnitude with our method.

 Energy Stability and Fracture for Frame Rate Rigid Body Simulations  ##   Our goal is to design robust algorithms that can be used for building real-time systems, but rather than starting with overly simplistic particle-based methods, we aim to modify higher-end visual effects algorithms. A major stumbling block in utilizing these visual effects algorithms for real-time simulation is their computational intensity. Physics engines struggle to fully exploit available resources to handle high scene complexity due to their need to divide those resources among many smaller time steps, and thus to obtain the maximum spatial complexity we design our algorithms to take only one time step per frame. This requires addressing both accuracy and stability issues for collisions, contact, and evolution in a manner significantly different from a typical simulation in which one can rely on shrinking the time step to ameliorate accuracy and stability issues. In this paper we present a novel algorithm for conserving both energy and momentum when advancing rigid body orientations, as well as a novel technique for clamping energy gain during contact and collisions. We also introduce a technique for fast and realistic fracture of rigid bodies using a novel collision-centered prescoring algorithm.

 Interactive Fluid-Particle Simulation using Translating Eulerian Grids  ##   We describe an interactive system featuring fluid-driven animation that responds to moving objects. Our system includes a GPU-accelerated Eulerian fluid solver that is suited for real-time use because it is unconditionally stable, takes constant calculation time per frame, and provides good visual fidelity. We dynamically translate the fluid simulation domain to track a user-controlled object. The fluid motion is visualized via its effects on particles which respond to the calculated fluid velocity field, but which are not constrained to stay within the bounds of the simulation domain. As particles leave the simulation domain, they seamlessly transition to purely particle-based motion, obscuring the point at which the fluid simulation ends. We additionally describe a hardware-accelerated volume rendering system that treats the particles as participating media and can render effects such as smoke, dust, or mist. Taken together, these components can be used to add fluid-driven effects to an interactive system without enforcing constraints on user motion, and without visual artifacts resulting from the finite extents of Eulerian fluid simulation methods.

 A Hybrid Approach to Multiple Fluid Simulation Using Volume Fractions  ##   This paper presents a hybrid approach to multiple fluid simulation that can handle miscible and immiscible fluids, simultaneously. We combine distance functions and volume fractions to capture not only the discontinuous interface between immiscible fluids but also the smooth transition between miscible fluids. Our approach consists of four steps: velocity field computation, volume fraction advection, miscible fluid diffusion, and visualization. By providing a combining scheme between volume fractions and level set functions, we are able to take advantages of both representation schemes of fluids. From the system point of view, our work is the first approach to Eulerian grid-based multiple fluid simulation including both miscible and immiscible fluids. From the technical point of view, our approach addresses the issues arising from variable density and viscosity together with material diffusion. We show that the effectiveness of our approach to handle multiple miscible and immiscible fluids through experiments.

 Heat Transfer Simulation for Modeling Realistic Winter Sceneries  ##   This paper presents a physically based method for simulating the heat transfers between the different environmental 			elements to synthesize realistic winter sceneries. We simulate the snow fall over the ground, as well as the 			conductive, convective and radiative thermal transfers using a finite volume method according to the variations of 			air and dew point temperatures, the amount of snow, cloud cover and day-night cycles. Our approach takes into 			account phase changes such as snow melting into water or water freezing into ice.

 Improved Variational Guiding of Smoke Animations  ##   Smoke   animations are hard to art-direct because simple changes in parameters such   as simulation resolution often lead to unpredictable changes in the final   result. Previous work has addressed this problem with a guiding approach   which couples low-resolution simulations – that exhibit the desired flow and behaviour – to the final, high-resolution simulation.   This is done in such a way that the desired low frequency features are to   some extent preserved in the high-resolution simulation. However, the steady   (i.e. constant) guiding used often leads to a lack of sufficiently high   detail, and employing time-dependent guiding is expensive because the matrix   of the resulting set of equations needs to be recomputed at every iteration.   We propose an improved mathematical model for Eulerian-based   simulations which is better suited for dynamic, time-dependent guiding of   smoke animations through a novel variational   coupling of the low- and high-resolution simulations. Our model results in a   matrix that does not require re-computation when the guiding changes over   time, and hence we can employ time-dependent guiding more efficiently both in   terms of storage and computational requirements. We demonstrate that   time-dependent guiding allows for more high frequency detail to develop   without losing correspondence to the low resolution simulation. Furthermore,   we explore various artistic effects made possible by time-dependent guiding.

 Tetrahedral Embedded Boundary Methods for Accurate and Flexible Adaptive Fluids  ##   When simulating fluids, tetrahedral methods provide flexibility  and ease of adaptivity that Cartesian grids find difficult to match. However, this approach has so far been limited by  two conflicting requirements. First, accurate simulation requires quality Delaunay meshes and the use of circumcentric  pressures. Second, meshes must align with potentially complex moving surfaces and boundaries, necessitating  continuous remeshing. Unfortunately, sacrificing mesh quality in favour of speed yields inaccurate velocities  and simulation artifacts. We describe how to eliminate the boundary-matching constraint by adapting recent  embedded boundary techniques to tetrahedra, so that neither air nor solid boundaries need to align with mesh  geometry. This enables the use of high quality, arbitrarily graded, non-conforming Delaunay meshes, which are simpler  and faster to generate. Temporal coherence can also be exploited by reusing meshes over adjacent timesteps to  further reduce meshing costs. Lastly, our free surface boundary condition eliminates the spurious currents that  previous methods exhibited for slow or static scenarios. We provide several examples demonstrating that our efficient  tetrahedral embedded boundary method can substantially increase the flexibility and accuracy of adaptive  Eulerian fluid simulation.

 Matching Fluid Simulation Elements to Surface Geometry and Topology  ##   We introduce an Eulerian liquid simulation framework  based on the         Voronoi diagram of a potentially unorganized collection of  pressure         samples. Constructing the simulation mesh in this way allows us         to place samples anywhere in the computational domain; we  exploit         this by choosing samples that accurately capture the geometry         and topology of the liquid surface. When combined with  high-resolution         explicit surface tracking this allows us to simulate nearly         arbitrarily thin features, while eliminating noise and other  artifacts         that arise when there is a resolution mismatch between the  simulation         and the surface—and allowing a precise inclusion of surface         tension based directly on and at the same resolution as the  surface         mesh. In addition, we present a simplified Voronoi/Delaunay mesh         velocity interpolation scheme, and a direct extension of  embedded         free surfaces and solid boundaries to Voronoi meshes.

 Unified Simulation of Elastic Rods, Shells, and Solids  ##   We develop an accurate, unified treatment of elastica. Following the  method of resultant-based formulation to its logical extreme, we derive a  higher-order integration rule, or elaston, measuring stretching,  shearing, bending, and twisting along any axis. The theory and  accompanying implementation do not distinguish between forms of  different dimension (solids, shells, rods), nor between manifold regions  and non-manifold junctions. Consequently, a single code accurately  models a diverse range of elastoplastic behaviors, including buckling,  writhing, cutting and merging. Emphasis on convergence to the continuum  sets us apart from early unification efforts.

 A Multiscale Approach to Mesh-based Surface Tension  ##   We present an approach to simulate flows driven by surface tension  based on triangle meshes. Our method consists of two simulation layers:  the first layer is an Eulerian method for simulating surface tension  forces that is free from typical strict time step  constraints. The second simulation layer is a Lagrangian finite element  method that simulates sub-grid scale wave details on the fluid surface. The surface wave simulation employs an unconditionally stable, symplectic time integration method that allows for a high propagation speed due to strong surface tension. Our approach can naturally separate the grid- and sub-grid scales based on a  volume-preserving  mean curvature flow. As our model for the sub-grid dynamics enforces a  local conservation of mass, it leads to realistic  pinch off and merging effects. In addition to this method for simulating   dynamic surface tension effects, we also present an efficient non-oscillatory approximation for capturing damped surface tension  behavior.  These approaches allow us to efficiently simulate complex phenomena associated with strong surface tension, such as Rayleigh-Plateau instabilities and crown splashes, in a short amount of  time.

 Physics-Inspired Topology Changes for Thin Fluid Features  ##   We propose a mesh-based surface tracking method for fluid animation  that both preserves fine surface details and robustly adjusts the  topology of the surface in the presence of arbitrarily thin features  like sheets and strands. We replace traditional re-sampling methods with a convex hull method for connecting surface features during topological changes. This technique permits arbitrarily thin fluid features with minimal re-sampling errors by reusing points from the original surface. We further reduce re-sampling artifacts with a subdivision-based mesh-stitching algorithm, and we use a higher order interpolating subdivision scheme to determine the location of any newly-created vertices. The resulting algorithm efficiently produces detailed fluid surfaces with arbitrarily thin features while maintaining a consistent topology with the underlying fluid simulation.

 Star-Contours for Efficient Hierarchical Self-Collision Detection  ##   Collision detection is a problem that has often been addressed  efficiently with the use of hierarchical culling data structures. In the subproblem of self-collision detection for triangle meshes, however, such hierarchical data structures lose much of their power, because triangles adjacent to each other cannot be distinguished from actually colliding ones unless individually tested. Shape regularity of surface patches, described in terms of orientation and contour conditions, was proposed long ago as a culling criterion for  hierarchical self-collision detection. However, to date, algorithms based on shape regularity had to trade conservativeness for efficiency,  because there was no known algorithm for efficiently performing 2D contour self-intersection tests. In this paper, we introduce a star-contour criterion that is amenable to hierarchical computations. Together with a thorough analysis of the tree traversal process in hierarchical self-collision detection, it has led us to novel hierarchical data structures and algorithms for efficient yet conservative self-collision detection. We demonstrate the application of our algorithm to several example animations, and we show that it consistently outperforms other approaches.

 A Practical Simulation of Dispersed Bubble Flow  ##   In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient framework for simulating dispersed bubble flow. Instead of modeling the complex hydrodynamics of numerous small bubbles explicitly, our method approximates the average motion of these bubbles using a continuum multiphase solver. Then, the subgrid interactions among bubbles are computed using our new stochastic solver. Using the proposed scheme, we can efficiently simulate complex scenes with millions of bubbles.

 Example-Based Wrinkle Synthesis for Clothing Animation  ##   This paper describes a method for animating the appearance of   clothing, such as pants or a shirt, that fits closely to a figure’s   body.  Compared to flowing cloth, such as loose dresses or capes,   these types of garments involve nearly continuous collision contact   and small wrinkles, that can be troublesome for traditional cloth   simulation methods.  Based on the observation that the wrinkles in   close-fitting clothing behave in a predominantly kinematic fashion,   we have developed an example-based wrinkle synthesis technique.  Our   method drives wrinkle generation from the pose of the figure’s   kinematic skeleton.  This approach allows high quality clothing   wrinkles to be combined with a coarse cloth simulation that computes   the global and dynamic aspects of the clothing motion.  While the   combined results do not exactly match a high-resolution reference   simulation, they do capture many of the characteristic fine-scale   features and wrinkles.  Further, the combined system runs at   interactive rates, making it suitable for applications where   high-resolution offline simulations would not be a viable option.   The wrinkle synthesis method uses a precomputed database built by   simulating the high-resolution clothing as the articulated figure is   moved over a range of poses.  In principle, the space of poses is   exponential in the total number of degrees of freedom; however   clothing wrinkles are primarily affected by the nearest joints,   allowing each joint to be processed independently.  During   synthesis, mesh interpolation is used to consider the influence of   multiple joints, and combined with a coarse simulation to produce   the final results at interactive rates.

 Dynamic Local Remeshing for Elastoplastic Simulation  ##   We propose a finite element simulation method that addresses the full range of material behavior, from purely elastic to highly plastic, for physical domains that are substantially reshaped by plastic flow, fracture, or large elastic deformations. To mitigate artificial plasticity, we maintain a simulation mesh in both the current state and the rest shape, and store plastic offsets only to represent the non-embeddable portion of the plastic deformation. To maintain high element quality in a tetrahedral mesh undergoing gross changes, we use a dynamic meshing algorithm that attempts to replace as few tetrahedra as possible, and thereby limits the visual artifacts and artificial diffusion that would otherwise be introduced by repeatedly remeshing the domain from scratch. Our dynamic mesher also locally refines and coarsens a mesh, and even creates anisotropic tetrahedra, wherever a simulation requests it. We illustrate these features with animations of elastic and plastic behavior, extreme deformations, and fracture.

 Subspace Self-Collision Culling  ##   We show how to greatly accelerate self-collision detection (SCD) for  reduced deformable models. Given a triangle mesh and a set of  deformation modes, our method precomputes Subspace Self-Collision  Culling (SSCC) certificates which, if satisfied, prove the absence of  self-collisions for large parts of the model. At runtime, bounding  volume hierarchies augmented with our certificates can aggressively cull  overlap tests and reduce hierarchy updates. Our method supports both  discrete and continuous SCD, can handle complex geometry, and makes no  assumptions about geometric smoothness or normal bounds. It is  particularly effective for simulations with modest subspace  deformations, where it can often verify the absence of self-collisions  in constant time. Our certificates enable low amortized costs, in time  and across many objects in multi-body dynamics simulations. Finally,  SSCC is effective enough to support self-collision tests at audio rates,  which we demonstrate by producing the first sound simulations of  clattering objects.

 Volume Contact Constraints at Arbitrary Resolution  ##   We introduce a new method for simulating frictional contact between  volumetric objects using interpenetration volume constraints.  When  applied to complex geometries, our formulation results in dramatically  simpler systems of equations than those of traditional mesh contact  models. Contact between highly detailed meshes can be simplified to a  single unilateral constraint equation, or accurately processed at  arbitrary geometry-independent resolution with simultaneous sticking and  sliding across contact patches. We exploit fast GPU methods for computing layered depth images, which  provides us with the intersection volumes and gradients necessary to  formulate the contact equations as linear complementarity problems.  Straightforward and popular numerical methods, such as projected  Gauss-Seidel, can be used to solve the system. We demonstrate our method in a number of scenarios and present results  involving both rigid and deformable objects at interactive rates.

 Filament based smoke with vortex shedding and variational reconnection  ##    Simulating fluids based on vortex filaments is highly attractive for the creation of special effects because it gives artists full control over the simulation using familiar tools like curve editors or the scripted generation of new vortex filaments over time. Because filaments offer a very compact description of fluid flow, real time applications like games or virtual reality are also possible. We present a complete model that includes moving obstacles with vortex shedding, all represented as filaments. Due to variational reconnection the long-time behavior of our method is excellent: Energy and momentum stay constant within reasonable bounds and computational complexity does not increase over time.

 Underwater Cloth Simulation with Fractional Derivatives  ##   We introduce the use of fractional differentiation for simulating cloth de formations underwater. The proposed approach is able to achieve realistic underwater deformations without simulating the Eulerian body of water in which the cloth is immersed. Instead, we propose a particle-based cloth model where half-derivative viscoelastic elements are included for describing both the internal and external dynamics of the cloth. These elements model the cloth responses to fluid stresses and are also able to emulate the memory-laden behavior of particles in a viscous fluid. As a result, we obtain fractional clothes, which are able to correctly depict the dynamics of the immersed cloth interacting with the fluid even though the fluid is not simulated. The proposed approach produces realistic underwater cloth deformations and has obvious advantages in simplicity and speed of computation in comparison to volumetric fluid simulation approaches.

 Constraint Based Simulation of Adhesive Contact  ##   Dynamics with contact are often formulated as a constrained optimization problem. This approach allows handling in an integrated manner both non-penetration and frictional constraints. Following developments in the computational mechanics field, we have designed an algorithm for adding the simulation of adhesive contact constraints in the context of state-of-the-art constraint-based contact solvers. We show that implicit adhesion constraints can be handled with minor changes to existing solvers, and we demonstrate our algorithm on a diverse range of objects, including mass-spring cloth, volumetric finite-element models, and rigid bodies.

 FASTCD: Fracturing-Aware Stable Collision Detection  ##   We present a collision detection (CD) method for complex and large-scale fracturing models that have geometric and topological changes. We first propose a novel dual-cone culling method to improve the performance of CD, especially self-collision detection among fracturing models. Our dual-cone culling method has a small computational overhead and a conservative algorithm. Combined with bounding volume hierarchies (BVHs), our dual-cone culling method becomes approximate. However, we found that our method does not miss any collisions in the tested benchmarks. We also propose a novel, selective restructuring method that improves the overall performance of CD and reduces performance degradations at fracturing events. Our restructuring method is based on a culling efficiency metric that measures the expected number of overlap tests of a BVH. To further reduce the performance degradations at fracturing events, we also propose a novel, fast BVH construction method that builds multiple levels of the hierarchy in one iteration using a grid and hashing. We test our method with four different large-scale deforming benchmarks. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our method shows a more stable performance for CD by improving the performance by a factor of up to two orders of magnitude at frames when deforming models change their mesh topologies.

 Enhancing Fluid Animation with Adaptive, Controllable, and Intermittent Turbulence  ##   This paper proposes a new scheme for enhancing fluid animation with controllable turbulence. An existing fluid simulation from ordinary fluid solvers is fluctuated by turbulent variation modeled as a random process of forcing. The variation is precomputed as a sequence of solenoidal noise vector fields directly in the spectral domain, which is fast and easy to implement. The spectral generation enables flexible vortex scale and spectrum control following a user prescribed energy spectrum, e.g. Kolmogorov’s cascade theory, so that the fields provide fluctuations in subgrid scales and/or in preferred large octaves. The vector fields are employed as turbulence forces to agitate the existing flow, where they act as a stimulus of turbulence inside the framework of the Navier-Stokes equations, leading to natural integration and temporal consistency. The scheme also facilitates adaptive turbulent enhancement steered by various physical or user-defined properties, such as strain rate, vorticity, distance to objects and scalar density, in critical local regions. Furthermore, an important feature of turbulent fluid, intermittency, is created by applying turbulence control during randomly selected temporal periods.

 Discrete Viscous Threads  ##   We present a continuum-based discrete model for thin threads of viscous fluid by drawing upon the Rayleigh analogy to elastic rods, demonstrating canonical coiling, folding, and breakup in dynamic simulations. Our derivation emphasizes space-time symmetry, which sheds light on the role of time-parallel transport in eliminating — without approximation — all but an O(n) band of entries of the physical system’s energy Hessian. The result is a fast, unified, implicit treatment of viscous threads and elastic rods that closely reproduces a variety of fascinating physical phenomena, including hysteretic transitions between coiling regimes, competition between surface tension and gravity, and the first numerical fluid-mechanical sewing machine. The novel implicit treatment also yields an order of magnitude speedup in our elastic rod dynamics.

 A parallel multigrid Poisson solver for fluids simulation on large grids  ##   We present a highly efficient numerical solver for the Poisson equation on irregular voxelized domains supporting an arbitrary mix of Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions. Our approach employs a multigrid cycle as a preconditioner for the conjugate gradient method, which enables the use of a lightweight, purely geometric multigrid scheme while drastically improving convergence and robustness on irregular domains. Our method is designed for parallel execution on shared-memory platforms and poses modest requirements in terms of bandwidth and memory footprint. Our solver will accommodate as many as 768X1152 voxels with a memory footprint less than 16GB, while a full smoke simulation at this resolution fits in 32GB of RAM. Our preconditioned conjugate gradient solver typically reduces the residual by one order of magnitude every 2 iterations, while each PCG iteration requires approximately 6.1 sec on a 16-core SMP at 768^3 resolution. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on animations of smoke flow past solid objects and free surface water animations using Poisson pressure projection at unprecedented resolutions.

 A Simple Geometric Model for Elastic Deformations  ##   We advocate a simple geometric model for elasticity: distance between the differential of a deformation and the rotation group. It comes with rigorous differential geometric underpinnings, both smooth and discrete, and is computationally almost as simple and efficient as linear elasticity. Owing to its geometric non-linearity, though, it does not suffer from the usual linearization artifacts. A material model with standard elastic moduli (Lame parameters) falls out naturally, and a minimizer for static problems is easily augmented to construct a fully variational 2nd order time integrator. It has excellent conservation properties even for very coarse simulations, making it very robust. Our analysis was motivated by a number of heuristic, physics-like algorithms from geometry processing (editing, morphing, parameterization, and simulation). Starting with a continuous energy formulation and taking the underlying geometry into account, we simplify and accelerate these algorithms while avoiding common pitfalls. Through the connection with the Biot strain of mechanics, the intuition of previous work that these ideas are “like” elasticity is shown to be spot on.

 A Novel Algorithm for Incompressible Flow Using Only A Coarse Grid Projection  ##   Large scale fluid simulation can be difficult using existing techniques due to the high computational cost of using large grids. We present a novel technique for simulating detailed fluids quickly. Our technique coarsens the Eulerian fluid grid during the pressure solve, allowing for a fast implicit update but still maintaining the resolution obtained with a large grid. This allows our simulations to run at a fraction of the cost of existing techniques while still providing the fine scale structure and details obtained with a full projection. Our algorithm scales well to very large grids and large numbers of processors, allowing for high fidelity simulations that would otherwise be intractable.

 Efficient Yarn-Based Cloth Simulation With Adaptive Contact Linearization  ##   Yarn-based cloth simulation can improve visual quality but at high computational costs due to the reliance on numerous persistent yarn-yarn contacts to generate material behavior. Finding so many contacts in densely interlinked geometry is a pathological case for traditional collision detection, and the sheer number of contact interactions makes contact processing the simulation bottleneck. In this paper, we propose a method for approximating penalty-based contact forces in yarn-yarn collisions by computing the exact contact response at one time step, then using a rotated linear force model to approximate forces in nearby deformed configurations. Because contacts internal to the cloth exhibit good temporal coherence, sufficient accuracy can be obtained with infrequent updates to the approximation, which are done adaptively in space and time. Furthermore, by tracking contact models we reduce the time to detect new contacts. The end result is a 7- to 9-fold speedup in contact processing and a 4- to 5-fold overall speedup, enabling simulation of character-scale garments.

 Real-Time Simulation of Large Bodies of Water with Small Scale Details  ##   We present a hybrid water simulation method that combines grid based and particles based approaches. Our specialized shallow water solver can handle arbitrary underlying terrain slopes, arbitrary water depth and supports wet-dry regions tracking. To treat open water scenes we introduce a method for handling non-reflecting boundary conditions. Regions of liquid that cannot be represented by the height field including breaking waves, water falls and splashing due to rigid and soft bodies interaction are automatically turned into spray, splash and foam particles. The particles are treated as simple non-interacting point masses and they exchange mass and momentum with the height field fluid. We also present a method for procedurally adding small scale waves that are advected with the water flow. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in various test scene including a large flowing river along a valley with beaches, big rocks, steep cliffs and waterfalls. Both the grid and the particles simulations are implemented in CUDA. We achieve real-time performance on modern GPUs in all the examples.

 Stable Spaces for Real-Time Clothing  ##   We present a technique for  learning clothing models that enables the simultaneous animation of  thousands of detailed garments in real-time. This surprisingly simple  conditional model learns and preserves the key dynamic properties of a  cloth motion along with folding details. Our approach requires no a  priori physical model, but rather treats training data as a ‘black box’.  We show that the models learned with our method are stable over large  time-steps and can approximately resolve cloth-body collisions. We also  show that within a class of methods, no simpler model covers the full  range of cloth dynamics captured by ours. Our method bridges the current  gap between skinning and physical simulation, combining benefits of  speed from the former with dynamic effects from the latter. We  demonstrate our approach on a variety of apparel worn by male and female  human characters performing a varied set of motions typically used in  video games (e.g., walking, running, jumping, etc.).

 Example-Based Wrinkle Synthesis for Clothing Animation  ##   This paper describes a method for animating the appearance of   clothing, such as pants or a shirt, that fits closely to a figure’s   body.  Compared to flowing cloth, such as loose dresses or capes,   these types of garments involve nearly continuous collision contact   and small wrinkles, that can be troublesome for traditional cloth   simulation methods.  Based on the observation that the wrinkles in   close-fitting clothing behave in a predominantly kinematic fashion,   we have developed an example-based wrinkle synthesis technique.  Our   method drives wrinkle generation from the pose of the figure’s   kinematic skeleton.  This approach allows high quality clothing   wrinkles to be combined with a coarse cloth simulation that computes   the global and dynamic aspects of the clothing motion.  While the   combined results do not exactly match a high-resolution reference   simulation, they do capture many of the characteristic fine-scale   features and wrinkles.  Further, the combined system runs at   interactive rates, making it suitable for applications where   high-resolution offline simulations would not be a viable option.   The wrinkle synthesis method uses a precomputed database built by   simulating the high-resolution clothing as the articulated figure is   moved over a range of poses.  In principle, the space of poses is   exponential in the total number of degrees of freedom; however   clothing wrinkles are primarily affected by the nearest joints,   allowing each joint to be processed independently.  During   synthesis, mesh interpolation is used to consider the influence of   multiple joints, and combined with a coarse simulation to produce   the final results at interactive rates.

 A Deformation Transformer for Real-Time Cloth Animation  ##   Achieving interactive performance in cloth animation has significant implications in computer games and other interactive graphics applications. Although much progress has been made, it is still much desired to have real-time high-quality results that well preserve dynamic folds and wrinkles. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid method for real-time cloth animation. It relies on data-driven models to capture the relationship between cloth deformations at two resolutions. Such data-driven models are responsible for transforming low-quality simulated deformations at the low resolution into high-resolution cloth deformations with dynamically introduced fine details. Our data-driven transformation is trained using rotation invariant quantities extracted from the cloth models, and is independent of the simulation technique chosen for the lower resolution model. We have also developed a fast collision detection and handling scheme based on dynamically transformed bounding volumes. All the components in our algorithm can be efficiently implemented on programmable graphics hardware to achieve an overall real-time performance on high-resolution cloth models.

 Practical Animation of Compressible Flow for Shockwaves and Related Phenomena  ##   We propose a practical approach to integrating shock wave dynamics into traditional smoke simulations. Previous methods either simplify away the compressible component of the flow and are unable to capture shock fronts or use a prohibitively expensive explicit method that limits the time step of the simulation long after the relevant shock waves and rarefactions have left the domain. Instead, we employ a semi-implicit formulation of Euler’s equations, which allows us to take time steps on the order of the fluid velocity (ignoring the more stringent acoustic wave-speed restrictions) and avoids the expensive characteristic decomposition typically required of compressible flow solvers. We also propose an extension to Euler’s equations to model combustion of fuel in explosions. The flow is two-way coupled with rigid and deformable solid bodies, treating the solid-fluid interface effects implicitly in a projection step by enforcing a velocity boundary condition on the fluid and integrating pressure forces along the solid surface. As we handle the acoustic fluid effects implicitly, we can artificially drive the sound speed c of the fluid to infinity without going unstable or driving the time step to zero. This permits the fluid to transition from compressible flow to the far more tractable incompressible flow regime once the interesting compressible flow phenomena (such as shocks) have left the domain of interest, and allows the use of state-of-the-art smoke simulation techniques.

 Reconstructing Surfaces of Particle-Based Fluids Using Anisotropic Kernels  ##   In this paper we present a novel surface reconstruction method for particle-based fluid simulators such as Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics. In particle-based simulations, fluid surfaces are usually defined as a level set of an implicit function. We formulate the implicit function as a sum of anisotropic smoothing kernels, and the direction of anisotropy at a particle is determined by performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) over the neighboring particles. In addition, we perform a smoothing step that re-positions the centers of these smoothing kernels. Since these anisotropic smoothing kernels capture the local particle distributions more accurately, our method has advantages over existing methods in representing smooth surfaces, thin streams and sharp features of fluids. Our method is fast, easy to implement, and our results demonstrate a significant improvement in the quality of reconstructed surfaces as compared to existing methods.

 Multi-Resolution Cloth Simulation  ##   We propose a novel, multi-resolution method to efficiently perform large-scale cloth simulation. Our cloth simulation method is based on a triangle-based energy model constructed from a cloth mesh. We identify that solutions of the linear system of cloth simulation are smooth in certain regions of the cloth mesh and solve the linear system on those regions in a reduced solution space. Then we reconstruct the original solutions by performing a simple interpolation from solutions computed in the reduced space. In order to identify regions where solutions are smooth, we propose simplification metrics that consider stretching, shear, and bending forces, as well as geometric collisions. Our multi-resolution method can be applied to many existing cloth simulation methods, since our method works on a general linear system. In order to demonstrate benefits of our method, we apply our method into four large-scale cloth benchmarks that consist of tens or hundreds of thousands of triangles. Because of the reduced computations, we achieve a performance improvement by a factor of up to one order of magnitude, with a little loss of simulation quality.

 Creature Control in a Fluid Environment  ##   In this paper, we propose a method designed to allow creatures to actively respond to a ﬂuid environment. We explore various objective functions in order to determine ways to direct the behavior of our creatures. Our proposed method works in conjunction with generalized body forces as well as both one-way and two-way coupled ﬂuid forces. As one might imagine, interesting behaviors can be derived from minimizing and maximizing both drag and lift as well as minimizing the effort that a creature’s internal actuators exert. A major application for our work is the automatic speciﬁcation of secondary motions, for example, certain joints can be animated while others are automatically solved for in order to satisfy the objective function.

 Multi-Resolution Isotropic Strain Limiting  ##   In this paper we describe a fast strain-limiting method that allows stiff, incompliant materials to be simulated efficiently. Unlike prior approaches, which act on springs or individual strain components, this method acts on the strain tensors in a coordinate-invariant fashion allowing isotropic behavior. Our method applies to both two- and three-dimensional strains, and only requires computing the singular value decomposition of the deformation gradient, either a small 2×2 or 3×3 matrix, for each element. We demonstrate its use with triangular and tetrahedral linear-basis elements. For triangulated surfaces in three-dimensional space, we also describe a complementary edge-angle-limiting method to limit out-of-plane bending. All of the limits are enforced through an iterative, non-linear, Gauss-Seidel-like constraint procedure. To accelerate convergence, we propose a novel multi-resolution algorithm that enforces fitted limits at each level of a non-conforming hierarchy. Compared with other constraint-based techniques, our isotropic multi-resolution strain-limiting method is straightforward to implement, efficient to use, and applicable to a wide range of shell and solid materials.

 Creating and Preserving Vortical Details in SPH Fluid  ##   We present a new method to create and preserve the turbulent details generated around moving objects in SPH fluid. In our approach, a high-resolution overlapping grid is bounded to each object and translates with the object. The turbulence formation is modeled by resolving the local flow around objects using a hybrid SPH-FLIP method. Then these vortical details are carried on SPH particles flowing through the local region and preserved in the global field in a synthetic way. Our method provides a physically plausible way to model the turbulent details around both rigid and deformable objects in SPH fluid, and can efficiently produce animations of complex gaseous phenomena with rich visual details.

 Multi-Phase Fluid Simulation Using Regional Level Sets  ##   We address the problem of Multi-Phase (or Many-Phase) Fluid simulations. We propose to use the regional level set (RLS) that can handle a large number of regions and materials, and hence, is appropriate for simulations of many immiscible materials. Towards this goal, we improve the interpolation of the RLS, and develop the regional level set graph (RLSG), which registers connected components and their contacts, and tracks their properties such as region volumes, film life times, and film material types, as regions evolve, merge, split, or are squeezed into films. Using RLSG’s tracking feature, we generate particles from tiny regions or rupturing films.

 Stable Inverse Dynamic Curves  ##   2d animation is a traditional but fascinating domain that has recently regained popularity both      in animated movies and video games. This paper introduces a method for automatically converting      a smooth sketched curve into a 2d dynamic curve at stable equilibrium under gravity. The curve      can then be physically animated to produce secondary motions in 2d animations or simple video      games. Our approach proceeds in two steps. We first present a new technique to fit a smooth      piecewise circular arcs curve to a sketched curve. Then we show how to compute the physical      parameters of a dynamic rod model (super-circle) so that its stable rest shape under gravity      exactly matches the fitted circular arcs curve. We demonstrate the interactivity and      controllability of our approach on various examples where a user can intuitively setup      efficient and precise 2d animations by specifying the input geometry.

 Animation Wrinkling: Augmenting Coarse Cloth Simulations with Realistic-Looking Wrinkles  ##   Moving garments and other cloth objects exhibit dynamic, complex wrinkles. Generating such wrinkles in a virtual environment currently requires either a time-consuming manual design process, or a computationally expensive simulation, often combined with accurate parameter-tuning requiring specialized animator skills. Our work presents an alternative approach for wrinkle generation which combines coarse cloth animation with a post-processing step for efficient generation of realistic-looking fine dynamic wrinkles. Our method uses the stretch tensor of the coarse animation output as a guide for wrinkle placement. To ensure temporal coherence, the placement mechanism uses a space-time approach allowing not only for smooth wrinkle appearance and disappearance, but also for wrinkle motion, splitting, and merging over time. Our method generates believable wrinkle geometry using specialized curve-based implicit deformers. The method is fully automatic and has a single user control parameter that enables the user to mimic different fabrics.

 Scalable Fluid Simulation using Anisotropic Turbulence Particles  ##   It is usually difficult to resolve the fine details of turbulent flows, especially when targeting real-time applications. We present a novel, scalable turbulence method that uses a realistic energy model and an efficient particle representation that allows for the accurate and robust simulation of small-scale detail. We compute transport of turbulent energy using a complete two-equation k–e model with accurate production terms that allows us to capture anisotropic turbulence effects, which integrate smoothly into the base flow. We only require a very low grid resolution to resolve the underlying base flow. As we offload complexity from the fluid solver to the particle system, we can control the detail of the simulation easily by adjusting the number of particles, without changing the large scale behavior. In addition, no computations are wasted on areas that are not visible. We demonstrate that due to the design of our algorithm it is highly suitable for massively parallel architectures, and is able to generate detailed turbulent simulations with millions of particles at high framerates.

 A Parallel SPH Implementation on Multi-core CPUs  ##   This paper presents a parallel framework for simulating fluids with the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method. For low computational costs per simulation step, efficient parallel neighborhood queries are proposed and compared. To further minimize the computing time for entire simulation sequences, strategies for maximizing the time step and the respective consequences for parallel implementations are investigated. The presented experiments illustrate that the parallel framework can efficiently compute large numbers of time steps for large scenarios. In the context of neighborhood queries, the paper presents optimizations for two efficient instances of uniform grids, i. e. spatial hashing and index sort. For implementations on parallel architectures with shared memory, the paper discusses techniques with improved cache-hit rate and reduced memory transfer.

 Detail-Preserving Fully Eulerian Interface Tracking Framework  ##   This paper introduces a fully-Eulerian interface tracking framework that preserves the fine details of liquids. Unlike existing Eulerian methods, the proposed framework shows good mass conservation even though it does not employ conventional Lagrangian elements. In addition, it handles complex merging and splitting of interfaces robustly due to the implicit representation. To model the interface more accurately, a high order polynomial reconstruction of the signed distance function is utilized based on a number of sub-grid quadrature points. By combining this accurate polynomial representation with a high-order re-initialization method, the proposed framework preserves the detailed structures of the interface. Moreover, the method is simple to implement, unconditionally stable, and is suitable for parallel computing environments.

 Piles of Objects  ##   We present a method for directly modeling piles of objects in multibody simulations. Piles of objects represent some of the more interesting, but also most time-consuming portion of simulation. We propose a method for reducing computation in many of these situations by explicitly modeling the piles that the objects may form into. By modeling pile behavior rather than the behavior of all individual objects, we can achieve realistic results in less time, and without directly modeling the frictional component that leads to desired pile shapes. Our method is simple to implement and can be easily integrated with existing rigid body simulations. We observe notable speedups in several rigid body examples, and generate a wider variety of piled structures than possible with strict impulse-based simulation.

 Vector Fluid: A Vector Graphics Depiction of Free Surface Flow  ##   We present a simple technique for creating fluid silhouettes described with vector graphics, which we call “Vector Fluid.” In our system, a solid region in the fluid is represented as a closed contour and advected by fluid flow to form a curly and clear shape similar to marbling or sumi-nagashi. The fundamental principle behind our method is that contours of solid regions should not collide. This means that if the initial shape of the region is a concave polygon, that shape should maintain its topology so that it can be rendered as a regular concave polygon, no matter how irregularly the contour is distorted by advection. In contrast to other techniques, our approach explicitly neglects topology changes to track surfaces in a trade off of computational cost and complexity. We also introduce an adaptive contour sampling technique to reduce this extra cost.

 Interactive SPH Simulation and Rendering on the GPU  ##   In this paper we introduce a novel parallel and interactive SPH simulation and rendering method on the GPU using CUDA which allows for high quality visualization. The crucial particle neighborhood search is based onZ-indexing and parallel sorting which eliminates GPU memory overhead due to grid or hierarchical data structures. Furthermore, it overcomes limitations imposed by shading languages allowing it to be very flexible and approaching the practical limits of modern graphics hardware. For visualizing the SPH simulation we introduce a new rendering pipeline. In the first step, all surface particles are efficiently extracted from the SPH particle cloud exploiting the simulation data. Subsequently, a partial and therefore fast distance field volume is rasterized from the surface particles. In the last step, the distance field volume is directly rendered using state-of-the-art GPU raycasting. This rendering pipeline allows for high quality visualization at very high frame rates.

 Fast Particle-Based Visual Simulation of Melting Ice  ##   The visual simulation of natural phenomena has been widely studied. Although several methods have been proposed to simulate melting, the flows of meltwater drops on the surfaces of objects are not taken into account. In this paper, we propose a particle-based method for the simulation of the melting and freezing of ice objects and the interactions between ice and fluids. To simulate the flow of meltwater on ice and the formation of water droplets, a simple interfacial tension is proposed, which can be easily incorporated into common particle-based simulation methods such as Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics. The computations of heat transfer, the phase transition between ice and water, the interactions between ice and fluids, and the separation of ice due to melting are further accelerated by implementing our method using CUDA. We demonstrate our simulation and rendering method for depicting melting ice at interactive frame-rates.

 Hybrid Simulation of Miscible Mixing with Viscous Fingering  ##   By modeling mass transfer phenomena, we simulate solids and liquids dissolving or changing to other substances.We also deal with the very small-scale phenomena that occur when a fluid spreads out at the interface of another fluid. We model the pressure at the interfaces between fluids with Darcy’s Law and represent the viscous fingering phenomenon in which a fluid interface spreads out with a fractal-like shape. We use hybrid grid-based simulation and smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) to simulate intermolecular diffusion and attraction using particles at a computable scale. We have produced animations showing fluids mixing and objects dissolving.

 Fast and Scalable CPU/GPU Collision Detection for Rigid and Deformable Surfaces  ##   We present a new hybrid CPU/GPU collision detection technique for rigid and deformable objects based on spatial subdivision. Our approach efficiently exploits the massive computational capabilities of modern CPUs and GPUs commonly found in off-the-shelf computer systems. The algorithm is specifically tailored to be highly scalable on both the CPU and the GPU sides. We can compute discrete and continuous external and self-collisions of non-penetrating rigid and deformable objects consisting of many tens of thousands of triangles in few milliseconds on a modern PC. Our approach is orders of magnitude faster than earlier CPU-based approaches and up to twice as fast as the most recent GPU-based techniques.

 Iso-geometric Analysis Based on Catmull-Clark Subdivision Solids  ##   We present a volumetric iso-geometric finite element analysis based on Catmull-Clark solids. This concept allows one to use the same representation for the modeling, the physical simulation, and the visualization, which optimizes the design process and narrows the gap between CAD and CAE. In our method the boundary of the solid model is a Catmull-Clark surface with optional corners and creases to support the modeling phase. The crucial point in the simulation phase is the need to perform efficient  integration for the elements. We propose a method similar to the standard subdivision surface evaluation technique, such that numerical quadrature can be used. Experiments show that our approach converges faster than methods based on tri-linear and tri-quadratic elements. However, the topological structure of Catmull-Clark elements is as simple as the structure of linear elements. Furthermore, the Catmull-Clark elements we use are C2-continuous on the boundary and in the interior except for irregular vertices and edges.

 Physics-Animation Forum?  ##   I was recently asked whether there exists any internet forum dedicated to physics-based animation. The two that came to mind are Gamedev’s Math & Physics forum and Bullet’s physics simulation forums (both linked in the right column of the page), though my impression is that these naturally tend to be focused towards games, and with somewhat greater emphasis on rigid bodies and collision detection. So I wanted to pose some questions to you…  Are there other forum sites that focus on physical simulation for computer graphics? If so please post a link in the comments. Would a dedicated physics-based animation forum be of genuine use to you? (Alternatively, do existing forums already serve this purpose, or do you not see a need for such a forum?)

 A Hexahedral Multigrid Approach for Simulating Cuts in Deformable Objects  ##   We present a hexahedral finite element method for simulating cuts in deformable bodies using the corotational formulation of strain at high computational efficiency. Key to our approach is a novel embedding of adaptive element refinements and topological changes of the simulation grid into a geometric multigrid solver. Starting with a coarse hexahedral simulation grid, this grid is adaptively refined at the surface of a cutting tool until a finest resolution level, and the cut is modeled by separating elements along the cell faces at this level. To represent the induced discontinuities on successive multigrid levels, the affected coarse grid cells are duplicated and the resulting connectivity components are distributed to either side of the cut. Drawing upon recent work on octree and multigrid schemes for the numerical solution of partial differential equations, we develop efficient algorithms for updating the systems of equations of the adaptive finite element discretization and the multigrid hierarchy. To construct a surface that accurately aligns with the cuts, we adapt the splitting cubes algorithm to the specific linked voxel representation of the simulation domain we use. The paper is completed by a convergence analysis of the finite element solver and a performance comparison to alternative numerical solution methods. These investigations show that our approach offers high computational efficiency and physical accuracy, and that it enables cutting of deformable bodies at very high resolutions.

 Constraint Fluids  ##   We present a fluid simulation method based on Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) in which incompressibility and boundary conditions are enforced using holonomic kinematic constraints on the density. This formulation enables systematic multiphysics integration in which interactions are modeled via similar constraints between the fluid pseudo-particles and impenetrable surfaces of other bodies. These conditions embody Archimede’s principle for solids and thus buoyancy results as a direct consequence. We use a variational time stepping scheme suitable for general constrained multibody systems we call SPOOK. Each step requires the solution of only one Mixed Linear Complementarity Problem (MLCP) with very few inequalities, corresponding to solid boundary conditions. We solve this MLCP with a fast iterative method. Overall stability is vastly improved in comparison to the unconstrained version of SPH, and this allows much larger time steps, and an increase in overall performance by two orders of magnitude. Proof of concept is given for computer graphics applications and interactive simulations.

 Hybrid Multiresolution Wire  ##   We describe a method for the visual interactive simulation of wires contacting with rigid multibodies. The physical model used is a hybrid combining lumped elements and massless quasistatic representations. The latter is based on a kinematic constraint preserving the total length of the wire along a segmented path which can involve multiple bodies simultaneously and dry frictional contact nodes used for roping, lassoing and fastening. These nodes provide stick and slide friction along edges of the contacting geometries. The lumped element resolution is adapted dynamically based on local stability criteria, becoming coarser as the tension increases, and up to the purely kinematic representation. Kinematic segments and contact nodes are added and deleted and propagated based on contact geometries and dry friction configurations. The method gives dramatic increase on both performance and robustness because it quickly decimates superfluous nodes without loosing stability, yet adapts to complex configurations with many contacts and high curvature, keeping a fixed, large integration time step. Numerical results demonstrating the performance and stability of the adaptive multiresolution scheme are presented along with an array of representative simulation examples illustrating the versatility of the frictional contact model.

 Langevin Particle: A Self-Adaptive Lagrangian Primitive For Flow Simulation Enhancement  ##   We develop a new Lagrangian primitive, named Langevin particle, to incorporate turbulent flow details in fluid simulation. A group of the particles are distributed inside the simulation domain based on a turbulence energy model with turbulence viscosity. A particle in particular moves obeying the generalized Langevin equation, a well-known stochastic differential equation that describes the particle’s motion as a random Markov process. The resultant particle trajectory shows self-adapted fluctuation in accordance to the turbulence energy, while following the global flow dynamics. We then feed back Langevin forces to the simulation based on the stochastic trajectory, which drive the flow with necessary turbulence. The new hybrid flow simulation method features nonrestricted particle evolution requiring minimal extra manipulation after initiation. The flow turbulence is easily controlled and the total computational overhead of enhancement is minimal based on typical fluid solvers.

 Optimization-based Fluid Simulation on Unstructured Meshes  ##   We present a novel approach to ﬂuid simulation, allowing us to take into account the surface energy in a precise manner. This new approach combines a novel, topology-adaptive approach to deformable interface tracking, called the deformable simplicial complexes method (DSC) with an optimization-based, linear ﬁnite element method for solving the incompressible Euler equations. The deformable simplicial complexes track the surface of the ﬂuid: the ﬂuid-air interface is represented explicitly as a piecewise linear surface which is a subset of tetrahedralization of the space, such that the interface can be also represented implicitly as a set of faces separating tetrahedra marked as inside from the ones marked as outside. This representation introduces insigniﬁcant and controllable numerical diffusion, allows robust topological adaptivity and provides both a volumetric ﬁnite element mesh for solving the ﬂuid dynamics equations as well as direct access to the interface geometry data, making inclusion of a new surface energy term feasible. Furthermore, using an unstructured mesh makes it straightforward to handle curved solid boundaries and gives us a possibility to explore several ﬂuid-solid interaction scenarios.

 A Nonsmooth Newton Solver for Capturing Exact Coulomb Friction in Fiber Assemblies  ##   We focus on the challenging problem of simulating thin elastic rods in contact, in the presence of friction. Most previous approaches in computer graphics rely on a linear complementarity formulation for handling contact in a stable way, and approximate Coulombs’s friction law for making the problem tractable. In contrast, following the seminal work by Alart and Curnier in contact mechanics, we simultaneously model contact and exact Coulomb friction as a zero finding problem of a nonsmooth function. A semi-implicit time-stepping scheme is then employed to discretizethe dynamics of rods constrained by frictional contact: this leads to a set of linear equations subject to an equality constraint involving a non-differentiable function. To solve this one-step problem we introduce a simple and practical nonsmooth Newton algorithm, which proves to be reasonably efficient and robust for systems that are not over-constrained. We show that our method is able to finely capture the subtle effects that occur when thin elastic rods with various geometries enter into contact, such as stick-slip instabilities in free configurations, entangling curls, resting contacts in braid-like structures, or the formation of tight knots under large constraints. Our method can be viewed as a first step towards the accurate modeling of dynamic fibrous materials.

 Guide Shapes for High Resolution Naturalistic Liquid Simulation  ##   Art direction of high resolution naturalistic liquid simulations is notoriously hard, due to both the chaotic nature of the physics and the computational resources required. Resimulating a scene at higher resolution often produces very different results, and is too expensive to allow many design cycles. We present a method of constraining or guiding a high resolution liquid simulation to stay close to a finalized low resolution version (either simulated or directly animated), restricting the solve to a thin outer shell of liquid around a guide shape. Our method is generally faster than an unconstrained simulation and can be integrated with a standard fluid simulator. We demonstrate several applications, with both simulated and hand-animated inputs.

 Articulated Swimming Creatures  ##   We present a general approach to creating realistic swimming behavior for a given articulated creature body. The two main components of our method are creature/fluid simulation and the optimization of the creature motion parameters. We simulate two-way coupling between the fluid and the articulated body by solving a linear system that matches acceleration at fluid/solid boundaries and that also enforces fluid incompressibility. The swimming motion of a given creature is described as a set of periodic functions, one for each joint degree of freedom. We optimize over the space of these functions in order to find a motion that causes the creature to swim straight and stay within a given energy budget. Our creatures can perform path following by first training appropriate turning maneuvers through offline optimization and then selecting between these motions to track the given path. We present results for a clownfish, an eel, a sea turtle, a manta ray and a frog, and in each case the resulting motion is a good match to the real-world animals. We also demonstrate a plausible swimming gait for a fictional creature that has no real-world counterpart.

 Data-Driven Elastic Models for Cloth: Modeling and Measurement  ##   Cloth often has complicated nonlinear, anisotropic elastic behavior due to its woven pattern and fiber properties. However, most current cloth simulation techniques simply use linear and isotropic elastic models with manually selected stiffness parameters. Such simple simulations do not allow differentiating the behavior of distinct cloth materials such as silk or denim, and they cannot model most materials with fidelity to their real-world counterparts. In this paper, we present a data-driven technique to more realistically animate cloth. We propose a piecewise linear elastic model that is a good approximation to nonlinear, anisotropic stretching and bending behaviors of various materials. We develop new measurement techniques for studying the elastic deformations for both stretching and bending in real cloth samples. Our setup is easy and inexpensive to construct, and the parameters of our model can be fit to observed data with a well-posed optimization procedure. We have measured a database of ten different cloth materials, each of which exhibits distinctive elastic behaviors. These measurements can be used in most cloth simulation systems to create natural and realistic clothing wrinkles and shapes, for a range of different materials.

 Example-Based Elastic Materials  ##   We propose an example-based approach for simulating complex elastic material behavior. Supplied with a few poses that characterize a given object, our system starts by constructing a space of prefered deformations by means of interpolation. During simulation, this example manifold then acts as an additional elastic attractor that guides the object towards its space of prefered shapes. Added on top of existing solid simulation codes, this example potential effectively allows us to implement inhomogeneous and anisotropic materials in a direct and intuitive way. Due to its example-based interface, our method promotes an art-directed approach to solid simulation, which we exemplify on a set of practical examples.

 Frame-Based Elastic Models  ##   We present a new type of deformable model which combines the realism of physically based continuum mechanics models and the usability of frame-based skinning methods. The degrees of freedom are coordinate frames. In contrast with traditional skinning, frame positions are not scripted but move in reaction to internal body forces. The displacement field is smoothly interpolated using dual quaternion blending. The deformation gradient and its derivatives are computed at each sample point of a deformed object and used in the equations of Lagrangian mechanics to achieve physical realism. This allows easy and very intuitive definition of the degrees of freedom of the deformable object. The meshless discretization allows on-the-fly insertion of frames to create local deformations where needed. We formulate the dynamics of these models in detail and describe some pre-computations that can be used for speed. We show that our method is effective for behaviors ranging from simple unimodal deformations to complex realistic deformations comparable with Finite Element simulations. To encourage its use, the software will be freely available in the simulation platform SOFA.

 Sparse Meshless Models of Complex Deformable Solids  ##   A new method to simulate deformable objects with heterogeneous material properties and complex geometries is presented. Given a volumetric map of the material properties and an arbitrary number of control nodes, a distribution of the nodes is computed automatically, as well as the associated shape functions. Reference frames attached to the nodes are used to apply skeleton subspace deformation across the volume of the objects. A continuum mechanics formulation is derived from the displacements and the material properties. We introduce novel material-aware shape functions in place of the traditional radial basis functions used in meshless frameworks. In contrast with previous approaches, these allow coarse deformation functions to efficiently resolve non-uniform stiffnesses. Complex models can thus be simulated at high frame rates using a small number of control nodes.

 On the Velocity of an Implicit Surface  ##   In this article we derive an equation for the velocity of an arbitrary time-evolving implicit surface. Strictly speaking, only the normal component of the velocity is unambiguously defined. This is because an implicit surface does not have a unique parametrization. However, by enforcing a constraint on the evolution of the normal field we obtain a unique tangential component. We apply our formulas to surface tracking and to the problem of computing velocity vectors of a motion blurred blobby surface. Other possible applications are mentioned at the end of the article.

 HOT: Hodge-Optimized Triangulations  ##   We introduce Hodge-optimized triangulations (HOT), a family of well-shaped primal-dual pairs of complexes designed for fast and accurate computations in computer graphics. Previous work most commonly employs barycentric or circumcentric duals; while barycentric duals guarantee that the dual of each simplex lies within the simplex, circumcentric duals are often preferred due to the induced orthogonality between primal and dual complexes. We instead promote the use of weighted duals (“power diagrams”). They allow greater flexibility in the location of dual vertices while keeping primal-dual orthogonality, thus providing a valuable extension to the usual choices of dual by only adding one additional scalar per primal vertex. Furthermore, we introduce a family of functionals on pairs of complexes that we derive from bounds on the errors induced by diagonal Hodge stars, commonly used in discrete computations. The minimizers of these functionals, called HOT meshes, are shown to be generalizations of Centroidal Voronoi Tesselations and Optimal Delaunay Triangulations, and to provide increased accuracy and flexibility for a variety of computational purposes.

 Solid Simulation with Oriented Particles  ##   We propose a new fast and robust method to simulate various types of solid including rigid, plastic and soft bodies as well as one, two and three dimensional structures such as ropes, cloth and volumetric objects. The underlying idea is to use oriented particles that store rotation and spin, along with the usual linear attributes, i.e. position and velocity. This additional information adds substantially to traditional particle methods. First, particles can be represented by anisotropic shapes such as ellipsoids, which approximate surfaces more accurately than spheres. Second, shape matching becomes robust for sparse structures such as chains of particles or even single particles because the undefined degrees of freedom are captured in the rotational states of the particles. Third, the full transformation stored in the particles, including translation and rotation, can be used for robust skinning of graphical meshes and for transforming plastic deformations back into the rest state.

 Real-Time Eulerian Water Simulation Using a Restricted Tall Cell Grid  ##   We present a new Eulerian fluid simulation method, which allows real-time simulations of large scale three dimensional liquids. Such scenarios have hitherto been restricted to the domain of off-line computation. To reduce computation time we use a hybrid grid representation composed of regular cubic cells on top of a layer of tall cells. With this layout water above an arbitrary terrain can be represented without consuming an excessive amount of memory and compute power, while focusing effort on the area near the surface where it most matters. Additionally, we optimized the grid representation for a GPU implementation of the fluid solver. To further accelerate the simulation, we introduce a specialized multigrid algorithm for solving the Poisson equation and propose solver modifications to keep the simulation stable for large time steps. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach in several real-world scenarios, all running above 30 frames per second on a modern GPU. Some scenes include additional features such as two-way rigid body coupling as well as particle representations of sub-grid detail.

 Real-time Large-deformation Substructuring  ##   This paper shows a method to extend 3D nonlinear elasticity model reduction to open-loop multi-level reduced deformable structures. Given a volumetric mesh, we decompose the mesh into several subdomains, build a reduced deformable model for each domain, and connect the domains using inertia coupling. This makes model reduction deformable simulations much more versatile: localized deformations can be supported without prohibitive computational costs, parts can be re-used and precomputation times shortened. Our method does not use constraints, and can handle large domain rigid body motion in addition to large deformations, due to our derivation of the gradient and Hessian of the rotation matrix in polar decomposition. We show real-time examples with multi-level domain hierarchies and hundreds of reduced degrees of freedom.

 Efficient Elasticity for Character Skinning with Contact and Collisions  ##   We present a new algorithm for near-interactive simulation of skeleton driven, high resolution elasticity models. Our methodology is used for soft tissue deformation in character animation. The algorithm is based on a novel discretization of corotational elasticity over a hexahedral lattice. Within this framework we enforce positive definiteness of the stiffness matrix to allow efficient quasistatics and dynamics. In addition, we present a multigrid method that converges with very high efficiency. Our design targets performance through parallelism using a fully vectorized and branch-free SVD algorithm as well as a stable one-point quadrature scheme. Since body collisions, self collisions and soft-constraints are necessary for real-world examples, we present a simple framework for enforcing them. The whole approach is demonstrated in an end-to-end production-level character skinning system.

 Two-Scale Particle Simulation  ##   We propose a two-scale method for particle-based fluids that allocates computing resources to regions of the fluid where complex flow behavior emerges. Our method uses a low- and a high-resolution simulation that run at the same time. While in the coarse simulation the whole fluid is represented by large particles, the fine level simulates only a subset of the fluid with small particles. The subset can be arbitrarily defined and also dynamically change over time to capture complex flows and small-scale surface details. The low- and high-resolution simulations are coupled by including feedback forces and defining appropriate boundary conditions. Our method offers the benefit that particles are of the same size within each simulation level. This avoids particle splitting and merging processes, and allows the simulation of very large resolution differences without any stability problems. The model is easy to implement, and we show how it can be integrated into a standard SPH simulation as well as into the incompressible PCISPH solver. Compared to the single-resolution simulation, our method produces similar surface details while improving the efficiency linearly to the achieved reduction rate of the particle number.

 Graph-based Fire Synthesis  ##   Yubo Zhang, Carlos Correa, Kwan-Liu Ma We present a novel graph-based data-driven technique for cost-effective fire modeling. This technique allows composing long animation sequences using a small number of short simulations. While traditional techniques such as motion graphs and motion blending work well for character motion synthesis, they cannot be trivially applied to fluids to produce results with physically consistent properties which are crucial to the visual appearance of fluids. Motivated by the motion graph technique used in character animations, we introduce a new type of graph which can be applied to create various fire phenomena. Each graph node consists of a group of compact spatialtemporal flow pathlines instead of a set of volumetric state fields. Consequently, achieving smooth transitions between discontinuous graph nodes for modeling turbulent fires becomes feasible and computationally efficient.The synthesized particle flow results allow direct particle controls which is much more flexible than a full volumetric representation of the simulation output. The accompanying video shows the versatility and potential power of this new technique for synthesizing realtime complex fire at the quality comparable to production animations.

 Robust Real-Time Deformation of Incompressible Surface Meshes  ##   Raphael Diziol, Jan Bender, Daniel Bayer We introduce an efficient technique for robustly simulating incompressible objects with thousands of elements in real-time. Instead of considering a tetrahedral model, commonly used to simulate volumetric bodies, we simply use their surfaces. Not requiring hundreds or even thousands of elements in the interior of the object enables us to simulate more elements on the surface, resulting in high quality deformations at low computation costs. The elasticity of the objects is robustly simulated with a geometrically motivated shape matching approach which is extended by a fast summation technique for arbitrary triangle meshes suitable for an efficient parallel computation on the GPU. Moreover, we present an oscillation-free and collision-aware volume constraint, purely based on the surface of the incompressible body. The novel heuristic we propose in our approach enables us to conserve the volume, both globally and locally. Our volume constraint is not limited to the shape matching method and can be used with any method simulating the elasticity of an object. We present several examples which demonstrate high quality volume conserving deformations and compare the run-times of our CPU implementation, as well as our GPU implementation with similar methods.

 A Simple Finite Volume Method for Adaptive Viscous Liquids  ##   Christopher Batty, Ben Houston We present the first spatially adaptive Eulerian fluid animation method to support challenging viscous liquid effects such as folding, coiling, and variable viscosity. We propose a tetrahedral node-based embedded finite volume method for fluid viscosity, adapted from popular techniques for Lagrangian deformable objects. Applied in an Eulerian fashion with implicit integration, this scheme stably and efficiently supports high viscosity fluids while yielding symmetric positive definite linear systems. To integrate this scheme into standard tetrahedral mesh-based fluid simulators, which store normal velocities on faces rather than velocity vectors at nodes, we offer two methods to reconcile these representations. The first incorporates a mapping between different degrees of freedom into the viscosity solve itself. The second uses a FLIP-like approach to transfer velocity data between nodes and faces before and after the linear solve. The former offers tighter coupling by enabling the linear solver to act directly on the face velocities of the staggered mesh, while the latter provides a sparser linear system and a simpler implementation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with animations of spatially varying viscosity, realistic rotational motion, and viscous liquid buckling and coiling.

 Procedural Fluid Modeling of Explosion Phenomena Based on Physical Properties  ##   Genichi Kawada, Takashi Kanai We propose a method to procedurally model the fluid flows of explosion phenomena by taking physical properties into account. Explosion flows are always quite difficult to control, because they easily disturb each other and change rapidly. With this method, the target flows are described by control paths, and the propagation flows are controlled by following these paths. We consider the physical properties, which are the propagations of the pressure generated by the ignition, the detonation state caused by the pressure and the fuel combustions. Velocity, density, temperature and pressure fields are generated procedurally, and the fluid flows are computed from these four fields based on grid-based fluid simulations. Using this method, we can achieve a fluid motion that closely resembles one generated solely through simulation. This method realizes the modeling of flows controlled frame by frame and follows the flow’s physical properties.

 Mathematical Foundation of the Optimization-Based Fluid Animation Method  ##   Kenny Erleben, Marek Misztal, J. Andreas Baerentzen We present the mathematical foundation of a fluid animation method for unstructured meshes. Key contributions not previously treated are the extension to include diffusion forces and higher order terms of non-linear force approximations. In our discretization we apply a fractional step method to be able to handle advection in a numerically simple Lagrangian approach. Following this a finite element method is used for the remaining terms of the fractional step method. The key to deriving a discretization for the diffusion forces lies in restating the momentum equations in terms of a Newtonian stress tensor. Rather than applying a straightforward temporal finite difference method followed by a projection method to enforce incompressibility as done in the stable fluids method, the last step of the fractional step method is rewritten as an optimization problem to make it easy to incorporate non-linear force terms such as surface tension.

 Mass and Momentum Conservation for Fluid Simulation  ##   Michael Lentine, Mridul Aanjaneya, Ronald Fedkiw Momentum conservation has long been used as a design principle for solid simulation (e.g. collisions between rigid bodies, mass-spring elastic and damping forces, etc.), yet it has not been widely used for fluid simulation. In fact, semi-Lagrangian advection does not conserve momentum, but is still regularly used as a bread and butter method for fluid simulation. In this paper, we propose a modification to the semi-Lagrangian method in order to make it fully conserve momentum. While methods of this type have been proposed earlier in the computational physics literature, they are not necessarily appropriate for coarse grids, large time steps or inviscid flows, all of which are common in graphics applications. In addition, we show that the commonly used vorticity confinement turbulence model can be modified to exactly conserve momentum as well. We provide a number of examples that illustrate the benefits of this new approach, both in conserving fluid momentum and passively advected scalars such as smoke density. In particular, we show that our new method is amenable to efficient smoke simulation with one time step per frame, whereas the traditional non-conservative semi-Lagrangian method experiences serious artifacts when run with these large time steps, especially when object interaction is considered.

 Physics-based Character Skinning using Multi-Domain Subspace Deformations  ##   Theodore Kim, Doug L. James We propose a domain-decomposition method to simulate articulated deformable characters entirely within a subspace framework. The method supports quasistatic and dynamic deformations, nonlinear kinematics and materials, and can achieve interactive time-stepping rates. To avoid artificial rigidity, or “locking,” associated with coupling low-rank domain models together with hard constraints, we employ penalty-based coupling forces. The multi-domain subspace integrator can simulate deformations efficiently, and exploits efficient subspace-only evaluation of constraint forces between rotated domains using the so-called Fast Sandwich Transform (FST). Examples are presented for articulated characters with quasistatic and dynamic deformations, and interactive performance with hundreds of fully coupled modes. Using our method, we have observed speedups of between three and four orders of magnitude over full-rank, unreduced simulations.

 SPH Granular Flow with Friction and Cohesion  ##   Ivan Alduan, Miguel Otaduy Combining mechanical properties of solids and fluids, granular materials pose important challenges for the design of algorithms for realistic animation. In this paper, we present a simulation algorithm based on smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) that succeeds in modeling important features of the behavior of granular materials. These features are unilateral incompressibility, friction and cohesion. We extend an existing unilateral incompressibility formulation to be added at almost no effort to an existing SPH-based algorithm for fluids. The main advantages of this extension are the ease of implementation, the lack of grid artifacts, and the simple two-way coupling with other objects. Our friction and cohesion models can also be incorporated in a seamless manner in the overall SPH simulation algorithm.

 A Particle-based Method for Preserving Fluid Sheets  ##   Ryoichi Ando, Reiji Tsuruno We present a new particle-based method that explicitly preserves thin fluid sheets for animating liquids. Our primary contribution is a meshless particle-based framework that splits at thin points and collapses at dense points to prevent the breakup of liquid. In contrast to existing surface tracking methods, the proposed framework does not suffer from numerical diffusion or tangles, and robustly handles topology changes by the meshless representation. As the underlying fluid model, we use Fluid-Implicit-Particle (FLIP) with weak spring forces to generate smooth particle-based liquid animation that maintains an even spatial particle distribution in the presence of eddying or inertial motions. The thin features are detected by examining stretches of distributions of neighboring particles by performing Principle Component Analysis (PCA), which is used to reconstruct thin surfaces with anisotropic kernels. Our algorithm is intuitively implemented, easy to parallelize and capable of producing visually complex thin liquid animations.

 Element-Wise Mixed Implicit-Explicit Integration for Stable Dynamic Simulation of Deformable Objects  ##   Basil Fierz, Jonas Spillman, Matthias Harders In order to evolve a deformable object in time, the underlying equations of motion have to be numerically integrated. This is commonly done by employing either an explicit or an implicit integration scheme. While explicit methods are only stable for small time steps, implicit methods are unconditionally stable. In this paper, we present a novel methodology to combine explicit and implicit linear integration approaches, based on element-wise stability considerations. First, we detect the ill-shaped simulation elements which hinder the stable explicit integration of the element nodes as a pre-computation step. These nodes are then simulated implicitly, while the remaining parts of the mesh are explicitly integrated. As a consequence, larger integration time steps than in purely explicit methods are possible, while the computation time per step is smaller than in purely implicit integration. During modifications such as cutting or fracturing, only newly created or modified elements need to be reevaluated, thus making the technique usable in real-time simulations. In addition, our method reduces problems due to numerical dissipation.

 Physics-inspired Upsampling for Cloth Simulation in Games  ##   Ladislav Kavan, Dan Gerszewski, Peter-Pike Sloan, Adam W. Bargteil We propose a method for learning linear upsampling operators for physically-based cloth simulation, allowing us to enrich coarse meshes with mid-scale details in minimal time and memory budgets, as required in computer games. In contrast to classical subdivision schemes, our operators adapt to a specific context (e.g. a flag flapping in the wind or a skirt worn by a character), which allows them to achieve higher detail. Our method starts by pre-computing a pair of coarse and fine training simulations aligned with tracking constraints using harmonic test functions. Next, we train the upsampling operators with a new regularization method that enables us to learn mid-scale details without overfitting. We demonstrate generalizability to unseen conditions such as different wind velocities or novel character motions. Finally, we discuss how to re-introduce high frequency details not explainable by the coarse mesh alone using oscillatory modes.

 Eulerian Solid Simulation with Contact  ##   David I. W. Levin, Joshua Litven, Garrett L. Jones, Shinjiro Sueda, Dinesh K. Pai Simulating viscoelastic solids undergoing large, nonlinear deformations in close contact is challenging. In addition to inter-object contact, methods relying on Lagrangian discretizations must handle degenerate cases by explicitly remeshing or resampling the object. Eulerian methods, which discretize space itself, provide an interesting alternative due to the fixed nature of the discretization. In this paper we present a new Eulerian method for viscoelastic materials that features a collision detection and resolution scheme which does not require explicit surface tracking to achieve accurate collision response. Time-stepping with contact is performed by the efficient solution of large sparse quadratic programs; this avoids constraint sticking and other difficulties. Simulation and collision processing can share the same uniform grid, making the algorithm easy to parallelize. We demonstrate an implementation of all the steps of the algorithm on the GPU. The method is effective for simulation of complicated contact scenarios involving multiple highly deformable objects, and can directly simulate volumetric models obtained from medical imaging techniques such as CT and MRI.

 A Level-set Method for Skinning Animated Particle Data  ##   Haimasree Bhattacharya, Yue Gao, Adam W. Bargteil In this paper, we present a straightforward, easy to implement method for particle skinning—generating surfaces from animated particle data. We cast the problem in terms of constrained optimization and solve the optimization using a level-set approach. The optimization seeks to minimize the thin-plate energy of the surface, while staying between surfaces defined by the union of spheres centered at the particles. Our approach skins each frame independently while preserving the temporal coherence of the underlying particle animation. Thus, it is well-suited for environments where particle skinning is treated as a post-process, with each frame generated in parallel. We demonstrate our method on data generated by a variety of fluid simulation techniques and simple particle systems.

 Large-Scale Dynamic Simulation of Highly Constrained Strands  ##   Shinjiro Sueda, Garrett L. Jones, David I. W. Levin, Dinesh K. Pai A significant challenge in applications of computer animation is the simulation of ropes, cables, and other highly constrained strand-like physical curves. Such scenarios occur frequently, for instance, when a strand wraps around rigid bodies or passes through narrow sheaths. Purely Lagrangian methods designed for less constrained applications such as hair simulation suffer from difficulties in these important cases. To overcome this, we introduce a new framework that combines Lagrangian and Eulerian approaches. The two key contributions are the reduced node, whose degrees of freedom precisely match the constraint, and the Eulerian node, which allows constraint handling that is independent of the initial discretization of the strand. The resulting system generates robust, efficient, and accurate simulations of massively constrained systems of rigid bodies and strands.

 Preview-Based Sampling for Controlling Gaseous Simulations  ##   Ruogang Huang, Zeki Melek, John Keyser In this work, we describe an automated method for directing the control of a high resolution gaseous fluid simulation based on the results of a lower resolution preview simulation. Small variations in accuracy between low and high resolution grids can lead to divergent simulations, which is problematic for those wanting to achieve a desired behavior. Our goal is to provide a simple method for ensuring that the high resolution simulation matches key properties from the lower resolution simulation. We first let a user specify a fast, coarse simulation that will be used for guidance. Our automated method samples the data to be matched at various positions and scales in the simulation, or allows the user to identify key portions of the simulation to maintain. During the high resolution simulation, a matching process ensures that the properties sampled from the low resolution simulation are maintained. This matching process keeps the different resolution simulations aligned even for complex systems, and can ensure consistency of not only the velocity field, but also advected scalar values. Because the final simulation is naturally similar to the preview simulation, only minor controlling adjustments are needed, allowing a simpler control method than that used in prior keyframing approaches.

 Asynchronous Integration with Phantom Meshes  ##   David Harmon, Qingnan Zhou, Denis Zorin Asynchronous variational integration of layered contact models provides a framework for robust collision handling, correct physical behavior, and guaranteed eventual resolution of even the most difﬁcult contact problems. Yet, even for low-contact scenarios, this approach is signiﬁcantly slower compared to its less robust alternatives — often due to handling of stiff elastic forces in an explicit framework. We propose a method that retains the guarantees, but allows for variational implicit integration of some of the forces, while maintaining asynchronous integration needed for contact handling. Our method uses phantom meshes for calculations with stiff forces, which are then coupled to the original mesh through constraints. We use the augmented discrete Lagrangian of the constrained system to derive a variational integrator with the desired conservation properties.

 A Fluid Pressure Solver Handling Separating Solid Boundary Conditions  ##   Nuttapong Chentanez, Matthias Mueller We present a multigrid method for solving the linear complementarity problem (LCP) resulting from discretizing the Poisson equation subject to separating solid boundary conditions in an Eulerian liquid simulation’s pressure projection step. The method requires only a few small changes to a multigrid solver for linear systems. Our generalized solver is fast enough to handle 3D liquid simulations with separating boundary conditions in practical domain sizes. Previous methods could only handle relatively small 2D domains in reasonable time because they used expensive quadratic programming (QP) solvers. We demonstrate our technique in several practical scenarios in which the omission of separating boundary conditions results in disturbing artifacts of liquid sticking to walls.

 Hybrid Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics  ##   Karthik Raveendran, Chris Wojtan, Greg Turk We present a new algorithm for enforcing incompressibility for Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) by preserving uniform density across the domain. We propose a hybrid method that uses a Poisson solve on a coarse grid to enforce a divergence free velocity field, followed by a local density correction of the particles. This avoids typical grid artifacts and maintains the Lagrangian nature of SPH by directly transferring pressures onto particles. Our method can be easily integrated with existing SPH techniques such as the incompressible PCISPH method as well as weakly compressible SPH by adding an additional force term. We show that this hybrid method accelerates convergence towards uniform density and permits a significantly larger time step compared to earlier approaches while producing similar results. We demonstrate our approach in a variety of scenarios with significant pressure gradients such as splashing liquids.

Our approach is applicable to various deforming meshes, including those with changing topologies, and efficiently computes the first time of contact. We are able to perform inter-object and intra-object collision queries in models represented with tens of thousands of volume elements at interactive rates on a single CPU core.

 Pattern Guided Smoke Animation with Lagrangian Coherent Structure  ##   Zhi Yuan, Fan Chen, Ye Zhao Fluid animation practitioners face great challenges from the complexity of flow dynamics and the high cost of numerical simulation. A major hindrance is the uncertainty of fluid behavior after simulation resolution increases and extra turbulent effects are added. In this paper, we propose to regulate fluid animations with predesigned flow patterns. Animators can design their desired fluid behavior with fast, low-cost simulations. Flow patterns are then extracted from the results by the Lagrangian Coherent Structure (LCS) that represents major flow skeleton. Therefore, the final high-quality animation is confined towards the designed behavior by applying the patterns to drive high-resolution and turbulent simulations. The pattern regulation is easily computed and achieves controllable variance in the output. The method makes it easy to design special fluid effects, which increases the usability and scalability of various advanced fluid modeling technologies.

 Adding Physics to Characters Using Oriented Particles  ##   Matthias Muller, Nuttapong Chentanez We present a method to enhance the realism of animated characters by adding physically based secondary motion to deformable parts such as cloth, skin or hair. To this end, we extend the oriented particles approach to incorporate animation information. In addition, we introduce techniques to increase the stability of the original method in order to make it suitable for the fast and sudden motions that typically occur in computer games. We also propose a method for the semi-automatic creation of particle representations from arbitrary visual meshes. This way, our technique allows us to simulate complex geometry such as hair, thick cloth with ornaments and multi-layered clothing, all interacting with each other and the animated character.

 SPH Based Shallow Water Simulation  ##   Barbara Solenthaler, Peter Bucher, Nuttapong Chentanez, Matthias Muller, Markus Gross We present an efficient method that uses particles to solve the 2D shallow water equations. These equations describe the dynamics of a body of water represented by a height field. Instead of storing the surface heights using uniform grid cells, we discretize the fluid with 2D SPH particles and compute the height according to the density at each particle location. The particle discretization offers the benefits that it simplifies the use of sparsely filled domains and arbitrary boundary geometry. Our solver can handle terrain slopes and supports two-way coupling of the particle-based height field with rigid objects. An improved surface definition is presented that reduces visible bumps related to the underlying particle representation. It furthermore smoothes areas with separating particles to achieve better rendering results. Both the physics and the rendering are implemented on modern GPUs resulting in interactive performances in all our presented examples.

 A Hybrid Iterative Solver for Robustly Capturing Coulomb Friction in Hair Dynamics  ##   Gilles Daviet, Florence Bertails-Descoubes, Laurence Boissieux Dry friction between hair fibers plays a major role in the collective hair dynamic behavior as it accounts for typical nonsmooth features such as stick-slip instabilities. However, due the challenges posed by the modeling of nonsmooth friction, previous mechanical models for hair either neglect friction or use an approximate smooth friction model, thus losing important visual features. In this paper we present a new generic robust solver for capturing Coulomb friction in large assemblies of tightly packed fibers such as hair. Our method is based on an iterative algorithm where each single contact problem is efficiently and robustly solved by introducing a hybrid strategy that combines a new zero-finding formulation of (exact) Coulomb friction together with an analytical solver as a fail-safe. Our global solver turns out to be very robust and highly scalable as it can handle up to a few thousand densely packed fibers subject to tens of thousands frictional contacts at a reasonable computational cost. It can be conveniently combined to any fiber model with various rest shapes, from smooth to curly. Our results, visually validated against real hair motions, depict typical hair collective effects and greatly enhance the realism of standard hair simulators.

 Multi-FLIP for Energetic Two-Phase Fluid Simulation  ##   Landon Boyd, Robert Bridson Physically-based liquid animations often ignore the inﬂuence of air, giving up interesting behaviour. We present a new method which treats both air and liquid as incompressible, more accurately reproducing the reality observed at scales relevant to computer animation. The Fluid Implicit Particle (FLIP) method, already shown to effectively simulate incompressible ﬂuids with low numerical dissipation, is extended to two-phase ﬂow by associating a phase bit with each particle. The liquid surface is reproduced at each time step from the particle positions, which are adjusted to prevent mixing near the surface and to allow for accurate surface tension. The liquid surface is adjusted around small-scale features so they are represented in the grid-based pressure projection, while separate, loosely coupled velocity ﬁelds reduce unwanted inﬂuence between the phases. The resulting scheme is easy to implement, requires little parameter tuning and is shown to reproduce lively two-phase ﬂuid phenomena.

 Explicit Mesh Surfaces for Particle Based Fluids  ##   Jihun Yu, Chris Wojtan, Greg Turk, Chee Yap We introduce the idea of using an explicit triangle mesh to track the air/fluid interface in a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulator. Once an initial surface mesh is created, this mesh is carried forward in time using nearby particle velocities to advect the mesh vertices. The mesh connectivity remains mostly unchanged across time-steps; it is only modified locally for topology change events or for the improvement of triangle quality. In order to ensure that the surface mesh does not diverge from the underlying particle simulation, we periodically project the mesh surface onto an implicit surface defined by the physics simulation. The mesh surface gives us several advantages over previous SPH surface tracking techniques. We demonstrate a new method for surface tension calculations that clearly outperforms the state of the art in SPH surface tension for computer graphics. We also demonstrate a method for tracking detailed surface information (like colors) that is less susceptible to numerical diffusion than competing techniques. Finally, our temporally-coherent surface mesh allows us to simulate high-resolution surface wave dynamics without being limited by the particle resolution of the SPH simulation.

 Steady state Stokes flow interpolation for fluid control  ##   Haimasree Bhattacharya, Michael Nielsen, Robert Bridson Fluid control methods often require surface velocities interpolated throughout the interior of a shape to use the velocity as a feedback force or as a boundary condition. Prior methods for interpolation in computer graphics — velocity extrapolation in the normal direction and potential flow — suffer from a common problem. They fail to capture the rotational components of the velocity field, although extrapolation in the normal direction does consider the tangential component. We address this problem by casting the interpolation as a steady state Stokes flow. This type of flow captures the rotational components and is suitable for controlling liquid animations where tangential motion is pronounced, such as in a breaking wave.

 STAR: Interactive Simulation of Rigid Body Dynamics in Computer Graphics  ##   Jan Bender, Kenny Erleben, Jeff Trinkle, Erwin Coumans Interactive rigid body simulation is an important part of many modern computer tools. No authoring tool nor a game engine can do without. The high performance computer tools open up new possibilities for changing how designers, engineers, modelers and animators work with their design problems. This paper is a self contained state-of-the-art report on the physics, the models, the numerical methods and the algorithms used in interactive rigid body simulation all of which has evolved and matured over the past 20 years. The paper covers applications and the usage of interactive rigid body simulation. Besides the mathematical and theoretical details that this paper communicates in a pedagogical manner the paper surveys common practice and reflects on applications of interactive rigid body simulation. The grand merger of interactive and off-line simulation methods is imminent, multi-core is everyman’s property. These observations pose future challenges for research which we reflect on. In perspective several avenues for possible future work is touched upon such as more descriptive models and contact point generation problems. This paper is not only a stake in the sand on what has been done, it also seeks to give newcomers practical hands on advices and reflections that can give experienced researchers afterthought for the future.

 Updated Sparse Cholesky Factors for Corotational Elastodynamics  ##   Florian Hecht, Yeon Jin Lee, Jonathan Shewchuk, James O’Brien We present warp-canceling corotation, a nonlinear finite element formulation for elastodynamic simulation that achieves fast performance by making only partial or delayed changes to the simulation’s linearized system matrices. Coupled with an algorithm for incremental updates to a sparse Cholesky factorization, the method realizes the stability and scalability of a sparse direct method without the need for expensive refactorization at each time step. This finite element formulation combines the widely used corotational method with stiffness warping so that changes in the per-element rotations are initially approximated by inexpensive per-node rotations. When the errors of this approximation grow too large, the per-element rotations are selectively corrected by updating parts of the matrix chosen according to locally measured errors. These changes to the system matrix are propagated to its Cholesky factor by incremental updates that are much faster than refactoring the matrix from scratch. A nested dissection ordering of the system matrix gives rise to a hierarchical factorization in which changes to the system matrix cause limited, well-structured changes to the Cholesky factor. We show examples of simulations that demonstrate that the proposed formulation produces results that are visually comparable to those produced by a standard corotational formulation. Because our method requires computing only partial updates of the Cholesky factor, it is substantially faster than full refactorization and outperforms widely used iterative methods such as preconditioned conjugate gradients. Our method supports a controlled trade-off between accuracy and speed, and unlike most iterative methods its performance does not slow for stiffer materials but rather it actually improves.

 Fluid Simulation Using Laplacian Eigenfunctions  ##   Tyler de Witt, Christian Lessig, Eugene Fiume We present an algorithm for the simulation of incompressible fluid phenomena that is computationally efficient and leads to visually convincing simulations with far fewer degrees of freedom than existing approaches. Rather than using an Eulerian grid or Lagrangian elements, we represent vorticity and velocity using a basis of global functions defined over the entire simulation domain. We show that choosing Laplacian eigenfunctions for this basis provides benefits, including correspondence with spatial scales of vorticity and precise energy control at each scale. We perform Galerkin projection of the Navier-Stokes equations to derive a time evolution equation in the space of basis coefficients. Our method admits closed form solutions on simple domains but can also be implemented efficiently on arbitrary meshes.

 Continuous Penalty Forces  ##   Min Tang, Dinesh Manocha, Miguel Otaduy, Ruofeng Tong We present a simple algorithm to compute continuous penalty forces to determine collision response between rigid and deformable models bounded by triangle meshes. Our algorithm provides a well-behaved solution in contrast to the traditional stability and robustness problems of penalty methods, induced by force discontinuities. We trace contact features along their deforming trajectories and accumulate penalty forces along the penetration time intervals between the overlapping feature pairs. Moreover, we present a closed-form expression to compute the continuous and smooth collision response. Our method has very small additional overhead compared to previous penalty methods, while significantly improves the stability and robustness. We highlight its benefits on several benchmarks.

 Super-Clothoids  ##   Florence Bertails-Descoubes Piecewise clothoids are 2D curves with continuous, piecewise linear curvature. Due to their smoothness properties, they have been extensively used in road design and robot path planning, as well as for the compact representation of hand-drawn curves. In this paper we present the Super-Clothoid model, a new mechanical model that for the first time allows for the computing of the dynamics of an elastic, inextensible piecewise clothoid. We first show that the kinematics of this model can be computed analytically depending on the Fresnel integrals, and precisely evaluated when required. Secondly, the discrete dynamics, naturally emerging from the Lagrange equations of motion, can be robustly and efficiently computed by performing and storing formal computations as far as possible, recoursing to numerical evaluation only when assembling the linear system to be solved at each time step. As a result, simulations turn out to be both interactive and stable, even for large displacements of the rod. Finally, we demonstrate the versatility of our model by handling various boundary conditions for the rod as well as complex external constraints such as frictional contact, and show that our model is perfectly adapted to inverse statics. Compared to lower-order models, the super-clothoid appears as a more natural and aesthetic primitive for bridging the gap between 2D geometric design and physics-based deformation.

 Computational Design of Rubber Balloons  ##   Melina Skouras, Bernhard Thomaszewski, Bernd Bickel, Markus Gross This paper presents an automatic process for fabrication-oriented design of custom-shaped rubber balloons. We cast computational balloon design as an inverse problem: given a target shape, we compute an optimal balloon that, when inflated, approximates the target as closely as possible. To solve this problem numerically, we propose a novel physics-driven shape optimization method, which combines physical simulation of inflatable elastic membranes with a dedicated constrained optimization algorithm. We validate our approach by fabricating balloons designed with our method and comparing their inflated shapes to the results predicted by simulation. An extensive set of manufactured sample balloons demonstrates the shape diversity that can be achieved by our method.

 Baroclinic Turbulence with Varying Density and Temperature  ##   Doyub Kim, Seung Woo Lee, Oh-young Song, Hyeong-Seok Ko The explosive or volcanic scenes in motion pictures involve complex turbulent flow as its temperature and density vary in space. To simulate this turbulent flow of an inhomogeneous fluid, we propose a simple and efficient framework. Instead of explicitly computing the complex motion of this fluid dynamical instability, we first approximate the average motion of the fluid. Then, the high-resolution dynamics is computed using our new extended version of the vortex particle method with baroclinity. This baroclinity term makes turbulent effects by generating new vortex particles according to temperature/density distributions. Using our method, we efficiently simulated a complex scene with varying density and temperature.

 Animating Bubble Interactions in a Liquid Foam  ##   Oleksiy Busaryev, Tamal Dey, Huamin Wang, Ren Zhong Bubbles and foams are important features of liquid surface phenomena, but they are difficult to animate due to their thin films and complex interactions in the real world. In particular, small bubbles (having diameter <1cm) in a dense foam are highly affected by surface tension, so their shapes are much less deformable compared with larger bubbles. Under this small bubble assumption, we propose a more accurate and efficient particle-based algorithm to simulate bubble dynamics and interactions. The key component of this algorithm is an approximation of foam geometry, by treating bubble particles as the sites of a weighted Voronoi diagram. The connectivity information provided by the Voronoi diagram allows us to accurately model various interaction effects among bubbles. Using Voronoi cells and weights, we can also explicitly address the volume loss issue in foam simulation, which is a common problem in previous approaches. Under this framework, we present a set of bubble interaction forces to handle miscellaneous foam behaviors, including foam structure under Plateau’s laws, clusters formed by liquid surface bubbles, bubble-liquid and bubble-solid coupling, bursting and coalescing. Our experiment shows that this method can be straightforwardly incorporated into existing liquid simulators, and it can efficiently generate realistic foam animations, some of which have never been produced in graphics before.

 Efficient Geometrically Exact Continuous Collision Detection  ##   Tyson Brochu, Essex Edwards, Robert Bridson Continuous collision detection (CCD) between deforming triangle mesh elements in 3D is a critical tool for many applications. The standard method involving a cubic polynomial solver is vulnerable to rounding error, requiring the use of ad hoc tolerances, and nevertheless is particularly fragile in (near-)planar cases. Even with per-simulation tuning, it may still cause problems by missing collisions or erroneously flagging non-collisions. We present a geometrically exact alternative guaranteed to produce the correct Boolean result (significant collision or not) as if calculated with exact arithmetic, even in degenerate scenarios. Our critical insight is that only the parity of the number of collisions is needed for robust simulation, and this parity can be calculated with simpler non-constructive predicates. In essence we analyze the roots of the nonlinear system of equations defining CCD through careful consideration of the boundary of the parameter domain. The use of new conservative culling and interval filters allows typical simulations to run as fast as with the non-robust version, but without need for tuning or worries about failure cases even in geometrically degenerate scenarios. We demonstrate the effectiveness of geometrically exact detection with a novel adaptive cloth simulation, the first to guarantee to remain intersection-free despite frequent curvature-driven remeshing.

 Data-Driven Estimation of Cloth Simulation Models  ##   Eder Miguel, Derek Bradley, Bernhard Thomaszewski, Bernd Bickel, Wojciech Matusik, Miguel Otaduy, Steve Marschner Progress in cloth simulation for computer animation and apparel design has led to a multitude of deformation models, each with its own way of relating geometry, deformation, and forces. As simulators improve, differences between these models become more important, but it is difficult to choose a model and a set of parameters to match a given real material simply by looking at simulation results. This paper provides measurement and fitting methods that allow nonlinear models to be fit to the observed deformation of a particular cloth sample. Unlike standard textile testing, our system measures complex 3D deformations of a sheet of cloth, not just one-dimensional force–displacement curves, so it works under a wider range of deformation conditions. The fitted models are then evaluated by comparison to measured deformations with motions very different from those used for fitting.

 Ghost SPH for Animating Water  ##   Hagit Schechter, Robert Bridson We propose a new ghost fluid approach for free surface and solid boundary conditions in Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) liquid simulations. Prior methods either suffer from a spurious numerical surface tension artifact or drift away from the mass conservation constraint, and do not capture realistic cohesion of liquid to solids. Our Ghost SPH scheme resolves this with a new particle sampling algorithm to create a narrow layer of ghost particles in the surrounding air and solid, with careful extrapolation and treatment of fluid variables to reflect the boundary conditions. We also provide a new, simpler form of artificial viscosity based on XSPH. Examples demonstrate how the new approach captures real liquid behaviour previously unattainable by SPH with very little extra cost.

 Lagrangian Vortex Sheets for Animating Fluids  ##   Tobias Pfaff, Nils Thuerey, Markus Gross Buoyant turbulent smoke plumes with a sharp smoke-air interface, such as volcanic plumes, are notoriously hard to simulate. The surface clearly shows small-scale turbulent structures which are costly to resolve. In addition, the turbulence onset is directly visible at the interface, and is not captured by commonly used turbulence models. We present a novel approach that employs a triangle mesh as a high-resolution surface representation combined with a coarse Eulerian solver. On the mesh, we solve the interfacial vortex sheet equations, which allows us to accurately simulate buoyancy induced turbulence. For complex boundary conditions we propose an orthogonal turbulence model that handles vortices caused by obstacle interaction. In addition, we demonstrate a re-sampling scheme to remove surfaces that are hidden inside the bulk volume. In this way we are able to achieve highly detailed simulations of turbulent plumes efficiently.

 Underwater Rigid Body Dynamics  ##   Steffen Weissman, Ulrich Pinkall We show that the motion of rigid bodies under water can be realistically simulated by replacing the usual inertia tensor and scalar mass by the so-called Kirchhoff tensor. This allows us to model fluid-body interaction without simulating the surrounding fluid at all. We explain some of the phenomena that arise and compare our results against real experiments. It turns out that many real scenarios (sinking bodies, balloons) can be matched using a single, hand-tuned scaling parameter. We describe how to integrate our method into an existing physics engine, which makes underwater rigid body dynamics run in real time.

 Stress Relief: Improving Structural Strength of 3D Printable Objects  ##   Ondrej Stava, Juraj Vanek, Bedrich Benes, Nathan Carr, Radomir Mech 3D printing is a rapidly maturing area that has shown great progress over the past couple of years. It is now possible to produce 3D printed objects with exceptionally high fidelity and precision. However, while the quality of 3D printing has gone up, both the time to print and material costs have remained high. Moreover, there is no guarantee that a printed model is structurally sound. Many times, the printed product does not survive cleaning, transportation, or handling, or it even collapses under its own weight. We present a system that addresses this issue by providing automatic detection and correction of the problematic cases. The structural problems are detected by combining a lightweight structure analysis solver with 3D medial axis approximations. After areas with high structural stress are found, the model is corrected by combining three approaches: hollowing, thickening, and strut insertion. This detection and correction repeats until all problematic cases are corrected. Our process is designed to create a model that is visually similar to the original model, while possessing greater structural integrity Stress Relief: Improving Structural Strength of 3D Printable Objects  Stress Relief: Improving Structural Strength of 3D Printable Objects http://hpcg.purdue.edu/?page=publication&id=164   ## May 9th, 2012  ##  Deformables   ##  http://www.physicsbasedanimation.com/2012/05/09/stress-relief-improving-structural-strength-of-3d-printable-objects/  
 PolyDepth: Real-Time Penetration Depth Computation using Iterative Contact-Space Projection  ##   Changsoo Je, Min Tang, Youngeun Lee, Minkyoung Lee, Young J. Kim We present a real-time algorithm that finds the Penetration Depth (PD) between general polygonal models based on iterative and local optimization techniques. Given an in-collision configuration of an object in configuration space, we find an initial collision-free configuration using several methods such as centroid difference, maximally clear configuration, motion coherence, random configuration, and sampling-based search. We project this configuration on to a local contact space using a variant of continuous collision detection algorithm and construct a linear convex cone around the projected configuration. We then formulate a new projection of the in-collision configuration onto the convex cone as a Linear Complementarity Problem (LCP), which we solve using a type of Gauss-Seidel iterative algorithm. We repeat this procedure until a locally optimal PD is obtained. Our algorithm can process complicated models consisting of tens of thousands triangles at interactive rates.

 Discrete Viscous Sheets  ##   Christopher Batty, Andres Uribe, Basile Audoly, Eitan Grinspun We present the first reduced-dimensional technique to simulate the dynamics of thin sheets of viscous incompressible liquid in three dimensions. Beginning from a discrete Lagrangian model for elastic thin shells, we apply the Stokes-Rayleigh analogy to derive a simple yet consistent model for viscous forces. We incorporate nonlinear surface tension forces with a formulation based on minimizing discrete surface area, and preserve the quality of triangular mesh elements through local remeshing operations. Simultaneously, we track and evolve the thickness of each triangle to exactly conserve liquid volume. This approach enables the simulation of extremely thin sheets of viscous liquids, which are difficult to animate with existing volumetric approaches. We demonstrate our method with examples of several characteristic viscous sheet behaviors, including stretching, buckling, sagging, and wrinkling.

While the utility of interactive editing for rigid body and articulated figure animations is widely recognized, a corresponding approach to deformable bodies has not been technically feasible before. We achieve interactive rates by combining spacetime model reduction, rotation-strain coordinate warping, linearized elasticity, and direct manipulation. This direct editing tool can serve the final stages of animation production, which often call for detailed, direct adjustments that are otherwise tedious to realize by re-simulation or frame-by-frame editing.

 Reflections on Simultaneous Impact  ##   Breannan Smith, Danny Kaufman, Etienne Vouga, Rasmus Tamstorf, Eitan Grinspun Resolving simultaneous impacts is an open and significant problem in collision response modeling. Existing algorithms in this domain fail to fulfill at least one of five physical desiderata. To address this we present a simple generalized impact model motivated by both the successes and pitfalls of two popular approaches: pair-wise propagation and linear complementarity models. Our algorithm is the first to satisfy all identified desiderata, including simultaneously guaranteeing symmetry preservation, kinetic energy conservation, and allowing break-away. Furthermore, we address the associated problem of inelastic collapse, proposing a complementary generalized restitution model that eliminates this source of nontermination. We then consider the application of our models to the synchronous time-integration of large-scale assemblies of impacting rigid bodies. To enable such simulations we formulate a consistent frictional impact model that continues to satisfy the desiderata. Finally, we validate our proposed algorithm by correctly capturing the observed characteristics of physical experiments including the phenomenon of extended patterns in vertically oscillated granular materials.

 Unified Spray, Foam, and Bubbles for Particle-Based Fluids  ##   Markus Ihmsen, Nadir Akinci, Gizem Akinci, Matthias Teschner We present a new model for diffuse material, i.e. water–air mixtures, that can be combined with particle-based ﬂuids. Diffuse material is uniformly represented with particles which are classiﬁed into spray, foam and air bubbles. Physically motivated rules are employed to generate, advect and dissipate diffuse material. The approach is realized as a post-processing step which enables efﬁcient processing and versatile handling. As interparticle forces and the inﬂuence of diffuse material onto the ﬂuid are neglected, large numbers of diffuse particles are efﬁciently processed to realize highly detailed small-scale effects. The presented results show that our approach can signiﬁcantly improve the visual realism of large-scale ﬂuid simulations.

 Parallel Surface Reconstruction for Particle-Based Fluids  ##   Gizem Akinci, Markus Ihmsen, Nadir Akinci, Matthias Teschner This paper presents a novel method that improves the efﬁciency of high-quality surface reconstructions for particle-based ﬂuids using Marching Cubes. By constructing the scalar ﬁeld only in a narrow band around the surface, the computational complexity and the memory consumption scale with the ﬂuid surface instead of the volume. Furthermore, a parallel implementation of the method is proposed. The presented method works with various scalar ﬁeld construction approaches. Experiments show that our method reconstructs high-quality surface meshes efﬁciently even on single-core CPUs. It scales nearly linearly on multi-core CPUs and runs up to ﬁfty times faster on GPUs compared to the original scalar ﬁeld construction approaches.

 Tracking Surfaces with Evolving Topology  ##   Morten Bojsen-Hansen, Hao Li, Chris Wojtan We present a method for recovering a temporally coherent, deforming triangle mesh with arbitrarily changing topology from an incoherent sequence of static closed surfaces. We solve this problem using the surface geometry alone, without any prior information like surface templates or velocity fields. Our system combines a proven strategy for triangle mesh improvement, a robust multi-resolution non-rigid registration routine, and a reliable technique for changing surface mesh topology. We also introduce a novel topological constraint enforcement algorithm to ensure that the output and input always have similar topology. We apply our technique to a series of diverse input data from video reconstructions, physics simulations, and artistic morphs. The structured output of our algorithm allows us to efficiently track information like colors and displacement maps, recover velocity information, and solve PDEs on the mesh as a post process.

 Soft Body Locomotion  ##   Jie Tan, Greg Turk, Karen Liu We present a physically-based system to simulate and control the locomotion of soft body characters without skeletons. We use the finite element method to simulate the deformation of the soft body, and we instrument a character with muscle fibers to allow it to actively control its shape. To perform locomotion, we use a variety of intuitive controls such as moving a point on the character, specifying the center of mass or the angular momentum, and maintaining balance. These controllers yield an objective function that is passed to our optimization solver, which handles convex quadratic program with linear complementarity constraints. This solver determines the new muscle fiber lengths, and moreover it determines whether each point of contact should remain static, slide, or lift away from the floor. Our system can automatically find an appropriate combination of muscle contractions that enables a soft character to fulfill various locomotion tasks, including walking, jumping, crawling, rolling and balancing.

 Fast Simulation of Skeleton-Driven Deformable Body Characters  ##   Junggon Kim, Nancy Pollard We propose a fast physically based simulation system for skeleton-driven deformable body characters. Our system can generate realistic motions of self-propelled deformable body characters by considering the two-way interactions among the skeleton, the deformable body, and the environment in the dynamic simulation. It can also compute the passive jiggling behavior of a deformable body driven by a kinematic skeletal motion. We show that a well-coordinated combination of (1) a reduced deformable body model with nonlinear finite elements, (2) a linear-time algorithm for skeleton dynamics, and (3) explicit integration can boost simulation speed to orders of magnitude faster than existing methods, while preserving modeling accuracy as much as possible. Parallel computation on the GPU has also been implemented to obtain an additional speedup for complicated characters. Detailed discussions of our engineering decisions for speed and accuracy of the simulation system are presented in the paper. We tested our approach with a variety of skeleton-driven deformable body characters, and the tested characters were simulated in real-time or near real-time.

 Adaptive Image-Based Intersection Volume  ##   Bin Wang, Francois Faure, Dinesh Pai A method for image-based contact detection and modeling, with guaranteed precision on the intersection volume, is presented. Unlike previous image-based methods, our method optimizes a non-uniform ray sampling resolution and allows precise control of the volume error. By cumulatively projecting all mesh edges into a generalized 2D texture, we construct a novel data structure, the Error Bound Polynomial Image (EBPI), which allows efficient computation of the maximum volume error as a function of ray density. Based on a precision criterion, EBPI pixels are subdivided or clustered. The rays are then cast in the projection direction according to the non-uniform resolution. The EBPI data, combined with ray-surface intersection points and normals, is also used to detect transient edges at surface intersections. This allows us to model intersection volumes at arbitrary resolution, while avoiding the geometric computation of mesh intersections. Moreover, the ray casting acceleration data structures can be reused for the generation of high quality images.

 Versatile Rigid-Fluid Coupling for Incompressible SPH  ##   Nadir Akinci, Markus Ihmsen, Gizem Akinci, Barbara Solenthaler, Matthias Teschner We propose a momentum-conserving two-way coupling method of SPH fluids and arbitrary rigid objects based on hydrodynamic forces. Our approach samples the surface of rigid bodies with boundary particles that interact with the fluid, preventing deficiency issues and both spatial and temporal discontinuities. The problem of inhomogeneous boundary sampling is addressed by considering the relative contribution of a boundary particle to a physical quantity. This facilitates not only the initialization process but also allows the simulation of multiple dynamic objects. Thin structures consisting of only one layer or one line of boundary particles, and also non-manifold geometries can be handled without any additional treatment. We have integrated our approach into WCSPH and PCISPH, and demonstrate its stability and flexibility with several scenarios including multiphase flow.

 Interactive Space-Time Control of Deformable Objects  ##   Klaus Hildebrandt, Christian Schulz, Christoph von Tycowicz, Konrad Polthier Creating motions of objects or characters that are physically plausible and follow an animator’s intent is a key task in computer animation. The spacetime constraints paradigm is a valuable approach to this problem, but it suffers from high computational costs. Based on spacetime constraints, we propose a framework for controlling the motion of deformable objects that offers interactive response times. This is achieved by a model reduction of the underlying variational problem, which combines dimension reduction, multipoint linearization, and decoupling of ODEs. After a preprocess, the cost for creating or editing a motion is reduced to solving a number of one-dimensional spacetime problems, whose solutions are the wiggly splines introduced by Kass and Anderson [2008]. We achieve interactive response times through a new fast and robust numerical scheme for solving the one-dimensional problems that is based on a closed-form representation of the wiggly splines.

 Energy-Based Self-Collision Culling for Arbitrary Mesh Deformations  ##   Changxi Zheng, Doug James In this paper, we accelerate self-collision detection (SCD) for a deforming triangle mesh by exploiting the idea that a mesh cannot self collide unless it deforms enough. Unlike prior work on subspace self-collision culling which is restricted to low-rank deformation subspaces, our energy-based approach supports arbitrary mesh deformations while still being fast. Given a bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) for a triangle mesh, we precompute Energy-based Self-Collision Culling (ESCC) certificates on bounding-volume-related sub-meshes which indicate the amount of deformation energy required for it to self collide. After updating energy values at runtime, many bounding-volume self-collision queries can be culled using the ESCC certificates. We propose an affine-frame Laplacian-based energy definition which sports a highly optimized certificate preprocess, and fast runtime energy evaluation. The latter is performed hierarchically to amortize Laplacian energy and affine-frame estimation computations. ESCC supports both discrete and continuous SCD with detailed and nonsmooth geometry. We demonstrate significant culling on various examples, with SCD speed-ups up to 26X.

 Topology Adaptive Interface Tracking Using the Deformable Simplicial Complex  ##   Marek Misztal, Andreas Baerentzen We present a novel, topology-adaptive method for deformable interface tracking, called the Deformable Simplicial Complex (DSC). In the DSC method, the interface is represented explicitly as a piecewise linear curve (in 2D) or surface (in 3D) which is a part of a discretization (triangulation/tetrahedralization) of the space, such that the interface can be retrieved as a set of faces separating triangles/tetrahedra marked as inside from the ones marked as outside (so it is also given implicitly). This representation allows robust topological adaptivity and, thanks to the explicit representation of the interface, it suffers only slightly from numerical diffusion. Furthermore, the use of an unstructured grid yields robust adaptive resolution. Also, topology control is simple in this setting. We present the strengths of the method in several examples: simple geometric flows, fluid simulation, point cloud reconstruction, and cut locus construction.

 Linear-Time Smoke Animation with Vortex Sheet Meshes  ##   Tyson Brochu, Todd Keeler, Robert Bridson We present the ﬁrst quality physics-based smoke animation method which runs in time approximately linear in the size of the rendered two-dimensional visual detail. Our fundamental representation is a closed triangle mesh surface dividing space between clear air and a uniformly smoky region, on which we compute vortex sheet dynamics to accurately solve inviscid buoyant ﬂow. We handle arbitrary moving no-stick solid boundaries and by default handle an inﬁnite domain. The simulation itself runs in time linear to the number of triangles thanks to the use of a well-conditioned integral equation treatment together with a Fast Multipole Method for linear-time summations, providing excellent performance. Basic zero-albedo smoke rendering, with embedded solids, is easy to implement for interactive rates, and the mesh output can also serve as an extremely compact and detailed input to more sophisticated volume rendering.

 Multiphase Flow of Immiscible Fluids on Unstructured Moving Meshes  ##   Marek Misztal, Kenny Erleben, Adam Bargteil, J. Fursund, Brian Bunch Christensen, Andreas Bærentzen, Robert Bridson In this paper, we present a method for animating multiphase ﬂow of immiscible ﬂuids using unstructured moving meshes. Our underlying discretization is an unstructured tetrahedral mesh, the deformable simplicial complex (DSC), that moves with the ﬂow in a Lagrangian manner. Mesh optimization operations improve element quality and avoid element inversion. In the context of multiphase ﬂow, we guarantee that every element is occupied by a single ﬂuid and, consequently, the interface between ﬂuids is represented by a set of faces in the simplicial complex. This approach ensures that the underlying discretization matches the physics and avoids the additional book-keeping required in grid-based methods where multiple ﬂuids may occupy the same cell. Our Lagrangian approach naturally leads us to adopt a ﬁnite element approach to simulation, in contrast to the ﬁnite volume approaches adopted by a majority of ﬂuid simulation techniques that use tetrahedral meshes. We characterize ﬂuid simulation as an optimization problem allowing for full coupling of the pressure and velocity ﬁelds and the incorporation of a second-order surface energy. We introduce a preconditioner based on the diagonal Schur complement and solve our optimization on the GPU.

 Energetically Consistent Invertible Elasticity  ##   Alexey Stomakhin, Russell Howes, Craig Schroeder, Joseph Teran We provide a smooth extension of arbitrary isotropic hyperelastic energy density functions to inverted configurations. This extension is designed to improve robustness for elasticity simulations with extremely large deformations and is analogous to the extension given to the first Piola-Kirchoff stress in [ITF04]. We show that our energy-based approach is significantly more robust to large deformations than the first Piola-Kirchoff. Furthermore, we show that the robustness and stability of a hyper-elastic model can be predicted from a characteristic contour, which we call its primary contour. The extension to inverted configurations is defined via extrapolation from a convex threshold surface that lies in the uninverted portion of the principal stretches space. The extended hyperelastic energy density yields continuous stress and unambiguous stress derivatives in all inverted configurations, unlike in [TSIF05]. We show that our invertible energy-density-based approach outperforms the popular hyperelastic corotated model, and we also show how to use the primary contour methodology to improve the robustness of this model to large deformations.

 Deformable Objects Alive!  ##   Stelian Coros, Sebastian Martin, Bernhard Thomaszewski, Christian Schumacher, Robert Sumner, Markus Gross We present a method for controlling the motions of active deformable characters. As an underlying principle, we require that all motions be driven by internal deformations. We achieve this by dynamically adapting rest shapes in order to induce deformations that, together with environment interactions, result in purposeful and physically-plausible motions. Rest shape adaptation is a powerful concept and we show that by restricting shapes to suitable subspaces, it is possible to explicitly control the motion styles of deformable characters. Our formulation is general and can be combined with arbitrary elastic models and locomotion controllers. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method by animating curve, shell, and solid-based characters whose motion repertoires range from simple hopping to complex walking behaviors.

 Mass-Splitting for Jitter-Free Parallel Rigid Body Simulation  ##   Richard Tonge, Feodor Benevolenski, Andrey Voroshilov We present a parallel iterative rigid body solver that avoids common artifacts at low iteration counts. In large or real-time simulations, iteration is often terminated before convergence to maximize scene size. If the distribution of the resulting residual energy varies too much from frame to frame, then bodies close to rest can visibly jitter. Projected Gauss-Seidel (PGS) distributes the residual according to the order in which contacts are processed, and preserving the order in parallel implementations is very challenging. In contrast, Jacobi-based methods provide order independence, but have slower convergence. We accelerate projected Jacobi by dividing each body mass term in the effective mass by the number of contacts acting on the body, but use the full mass to apply impulses. We further accelerate the method by solving contacts in blocks, providing wallclock performance competitive with PGS while avoiding visible artifacts. We prove convergence to the solution of the underlying linear complementarity problem and present results for our GPU implementation,which can simulate a pile of 5000 objects with no visible jittering at over 60 FPS.

 Efficient Collision Detection for Brittle Fracture  ##   Loiez Glondu, Sarah Schvartzman, Maud Marchal, Georges Dumon, Miguel Otaduy In complex scenes with many objects, collision detection plays a key role in the simulation performance. This is particularly true for fracture simulation, where multiple new objects are dynamically created. In this paper, we present novel algorithms and data structures for collision detection in real-time brittle fracture simulations. We build on a combination of well-known efficient data structures, namely distance fields and sphere trees, making our algorithm easy to integrate on existing simulation engines. We propose novel methods to construct these data structures, such that they can be efficiently updated upon fracture events and integrated in a simple yet effective self-adapting contact selection algorithm. Altogether, we drastically reduce the cost of both collision detection and collision response. We have evaluated our global solution for collision detection on challenging scenarios, achieving high frame rates suited for hard real-time applications such as video games or haptics. Our solution opens promising perspectives for complex brittle fracture simulations involving many dynamically created objects.

 Mass-Conserving Eulerian Liquid Simulation  ##   Nuttapong Chentanez, Matthias Mueller We present a GPU friendly, Eulerian, free surface fluid simulation method that conserves mass locally and globally without the use of Lagrangian components. Local mass conservation prevents small scale details of the free surface from disappearing, a problem that plagues many previous approaches, while global mass conservation ensures that the total volume of the liquid does not decrease over time. Our method handles moving solid boundaries as well as cells that are partially filled with solids. Due to its stability, it allows the use of large time steps which makes it suitable for both off-line and real-time applications. We achieve this by using density based surface tracking with a novel, unconditionally stable, conservative advection scheme and a novel interface sharpening method. While our approach conserves mass, volume loss is still possible but only temporarily. With constant mass, local volume loss causes a local increase of the density used for surface tracking which we detect and correct over time. We also propose a density post-processing method to reveal sub-grid details of the liquid surface. We show the effectiveness of the proposed method in several practical examples all running either at interactive rates or in real-time.

 Simulating Free Surface Flow with Very Large Timesteps  ##   Michael Lentine, Matthew Cong, Saket Patkar, Ron Fedkiw We provide a novel simulation method for incompressible free surface flows that allows for large time steps on the order of 10-40 times bigger than the typical explicit time step restriction would allow. Although semi-Lagrangian advection allows for this from the standpoint of stability, large time steps typically produce significant visual errors. This was addressed in previous work for smoke simulation using a mass and momentum conserving version of semi-Lagrangian advection, and while its extension to water for momentum conservation for small time steps was addressed, pronounced issues remain when taking large time steps. The main difference between smoke and water is that smoke has a globally defined velocity field whereas water needs to move in a manner uninfluenced by the surrounding air flow, and this poses real issues in determining an appropriate extrapolated velocity field. We alleviate problems with the extrapolated velocity field by not using it when it is incorrect, which we determine via conservative advection of a color function which adds forwardly advected semi-Lagrangian rays to maintain conservation when mass is lost. We note that one might also use a more traditional volume-of-fluid method which is more explicitly focused on the geometry of the interface but can be less visually appealing — it is also unclear how to extend volume-of-fluid methods to have larger time steps. Finally, we prefer the visual smoothness of a particle level set method coupled to a traditional backward tracing semi-Lagrangian advection where possible, only using our forward traced color function solution in areas of the flow where the particle level set method fails due to the extremely large time steps.

 Smoke Sheets for Graph-Structured Vortex Filaments  ##   Alfred Barnat, Nancy S. Pollard Smoke is one of the core phenomena which fluid simulation techniques in computer graphics have attempted to capture. It is both well understood mathematically and important in lending realism to computer generated effects. In an attempt to overcome the diffusion inherent to Eulerian grid-based simulators, a technique has recently been developed which represents velocity using a sparse set of vortex filaments. This has the advantage of providing an easily understandable and controllable model for fluid velocity, but is computationally expensive because each filament affects the fluid velocity over an unbounded region of the simulation space. We present an alternative to existing techniques which merge adjacent filament rings, instead allowing filaments to form arbitrary structures,and we develop a new set of reconnection criteria to take advantage of this filament graph. To complement this technique, we also introduce a method for smoke surface tracking and rendering designed to minimize the number of sample points without introducing excessive diffusion or blurring. Though this representation lends itself to straightforward real-time rendering, we also present a method which renders the thin sheets and curls of smoke as diffuse volumes using any GPU capable of supporting geometry shaders.

 Controlling Liquids Using Meshes  ##   Karthik Raveendran, Nils Thuerey, Chris Wojtan, Greg Turk We present an approach for artist-directed animation of liquids using multiple levels of control over the simulation, ranging from the overall tracking of desired shapes to highly detailed secondary effects such as dripping streams, separating sheets of fluid, surface waves and ripples. The first portion of our technique is a volume preserving morph that allows the animator to produce a plausible fluid-like motion from a sparse set of control meshes. By rasterizing the resulting control meshes onto the simulation grid, the mesh velocities act as boundary conditions during the projection step of the fluid simulation. We can then blend this motion together with uncontrolled fluid velocities to achieve a more relaxed control over the fluid that captures natural inertial effects. Our method can produce highly detailed liquid surfaces with control over sub-grid details by using a mesh-based surface tracker on top of a coarse grid-based fluid simulation. We can create ripples and waves on the fluid surface attracting the surface mesh to the control mesh with spring-like forces and also by running a wave simulation over the surface mesh. Our video results demonstrate how our control scheme can be used to create animated characters and shapes that are made of water.

 SIGGRAPH Course: FEM Simulation of 3D Deformable Solids: A practitioner's guide to theory, discretization and model reduction  ##   Eftychios Sifakis and Jernej Barbic A practical guide to finite-element-method (FEM) simulation of 3D deformable solids reviews essential offline FEM simulation techniques: complex nonlinear materials, invertible treatment of elasticity, and model-reduction techniques for real-time simulation. Simulations of deformable solids are important in many applications in computer graphics, including film special effects, computer games, and virtual surgery. FEM has become a popular method in many applications. Both offline simulation and real-time techniques have matured in computer graphics literature. This course is designed for attendees familiar with numerical simulation in computer graphics who would like to obtain a cohesive picture of the various FEM simulation methods available, their strengths and weaknesses, and their applicability in various simulation scenarios. The course is also a practical implementation guide for the visual-effects developer, offering a very lean yet adequate synopsis of the underlying mathematical theory. The first section introduces FEM deformable-object simulation and its fundamental concepts, such as deformation gradient, strain, stress, and elastic energy, discusses corotational FEM models, isotropic hyperelasticity, and numerical methods such as conjugate gradients and multigrid. The second section presents the state of the art in model reduction techniques for real-time FEM solid simulation.

 SIGGRAPH Course: Data-Driven Simulation Methods in Computer Graphics: Cloth, Tissue, and Faces  ##   Miguel Otaduy, Bernd Bickel, Derek Bradley, Huamin Wang In recent years, the field of computer animation has witnessed the invention of multiple simulation methods that exploit pre-recorded data to improve the performance and/or realism of dynamic deformations. Various methods have been presented concurrently, and they present differences, but also similarities, that have not yet been analyzed or discussed. This course focuses on the application of data-driven methods to three areas of computer animation, namely dynamic deformation of faces, soft volumetric tissue, and cloth. The course describes the particular challenges tackled in a data-driven manner, classifies the various methods, and also shares insights for the application to other settings. The explosion of data-driven animation methods and the success of their results make this course extremely timely. Up till now, the proposed methods have remained familiar only at the research context, and have not made their way through computer graphics industry. This course aims to fit two main purposes. First, present a common theory and understanding of data-driven methods for dynamic deformations that may inspire the development of novel solutions, and second, bridge the gap with industry, by making data-driven approaches accessible. The course targets an audience consisting of both researchers and programmers in computer animation.

 Interactive High-Resolution Boundary Surfaces for Deformable Bodies with Changing Topology  ##   Jun Wu, Christian Dick, Rudiger Westermann Recent work has demonstrated that composite finite-elements provide an effective means for physically based modeling of deformable bodies. In this paper we present a number of highly effective improvements of previous work to allow for a high-performance and high-quality simulation of boundary surfaces of deformable bodies with changing topology, for instance, due to cuts and incisions. Starting at a coarse resolution simulation grid, along a cut we perform an adaptive octree refinement of this grid down to a desired resolution and iteratively pull the fine level finite-element equations to the coarse level. In this way, the fine level dynamics can be approximated with a small number of degrees of freedom at the coarse level. By embedding the hierarchical adaptive composite finite-element scheme into a geometric multigrid solver, and by exploiting the fact that during cutting only a small number of cells are modified in each time step, high update rates can be achieved for high resolution surfaces at very good approximation quality.  To construct a high quality surface that is accurately aligned with a cut, we employ the dual-contouring approach on the fine resolution level, and we instantly bind the constructed triangle mesh to the coarse grid via geometric constrains.

 Synthesizing Waves from Animated Height Fields  ##   Michael B. Nielsen, Andreas Soderstrom, Robert Bridson Computer animated ocean waves for feature ﬁlms are typically carefully choreographed to match the vision of the director and to support the telling of the story. The rough shape of these waves is established in the previsualization (previs) stage, where artists use a variety of modeling tools with fast feedback to obtain the desired look. This poses a challenge to the effects artists who must subsequently match the locked-down look of the previs waves with high-quality simulated or synthesized waves, adding the detail necessary for the ﬁnal shot. We propose a set of automated techniques for synthesizing Fourier-based ocean waves that match a previs input, allowing artists to quickly enhance the input wave animation with additional higher frequency detail that moves consistently with the coarse waves, tweak the wave shapes to ﬂatten troughs and sharpen peaks if desired (as is characteristic of deep water waves), and compute a physically reasonable velocity ﬁeld of the water analytically. These properties are demonstrated with several examples, including a previs scene from a visual effects production environment.

 Adaptive Anisotropic Remeshing for Cloth Simulation  ##   Rahul Narain, Armin Samii, James O’Brien We present a technique for cloth simulation that dynamically refines and coarsens triangle meshes so that they automatically conform to the geometric and dynamic detail of the simulated cloth. Our technique produces anisotropic meshes that adapt to surface curvature and velocity gradients, allowing efficient modeling of wrinkles and waves. By anticipating buckling and wrinkle formation, our technique preserves fine-scale dynamic behavior. Our algorithm for adaptive anisotropic remeshing is simple to implement, takes up only a small fraction of the total simulation time, and provides substantial computational speedup without compromising the fidelity of the simulation. We also introduce a novel technique for strain limiting by posing it as a nonlinear optimization problem. This formulation works for arbitrary non-uniform and anisotropic meshes, and converges more rapidly than existing solvers based on Jacobi or Gauss-Seidel iterations.

 Efficient Simulation of Example-Based Materials  ##   Christian Schumacher, Bernhard Thomaszewski, Stelian Coros, Sebastian Martin, Robert Sumner, Markus Gross We present a new method for efﬁciently simulating art-directable deformable materials. We use example poses to deﬁne subspaces of desirable deformations via linear interpolation. As a central aspect of our approach, we use an incompatible representation for input and interpolated poses that allows us to interpolate between elements individually. This enables us to bypass costly reconstruction steps and we thus achieve signiﬁcant performance improvements compared to previous work. As a natural continuation, we furthermore present a formulation of example-based plasticity. Finally, we extend the directability of example-based materials and explore a number of powerful control mechanisms. We demonstrate these novel concepts on a number of solid and shell animations including artistic deformation behaviors, cartoon physics, and example-based pose space dynamics.

 Rig-Space Physics  ##   Fabian Hahn, Sebastian Martin, Bernhard Thomaszewski, Robert Sumner, Stelian Coros, Markus Gross We present a method that brings the beneﬁts of physics-based simulations to traditional animation pipelines. We formulate the equations of motions in the subspace of deformations deﬁned by an animator’s rig. Our framework ﬁts seamlessly into the workﬂow typically employed by artists, as our output consists of animation curves that are identical in nature to the result of manual keyframing. Artists can therefore explore the full spectrum between handcrafted animation and unrestricted physical simulation. To enhance the artist’s control, we provide a method that transforms stiffness values deﬁned on rig parameters to a non-homogeneous distribution of material parameters for the underlying FEM model. In addition, we use automatically extracted high-level rig parameters to intuitively edit the results of our simulations, and also to speed up computation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we create compelling results by adding rich physical motions to coarse input animations. In the absence of artist input, we create realistic passive motion directly in rig space.

 Large-scale Fluid Simulation using Velocity-Vorticity Domain Decomposition  ##   Abhinav Golas, Rahul Narain, Jason Sewall, Pavel Krajcevski, Pradeep Dubey, Ming Lin Simulating fluids in large-scale scenes with appreciable quality using state-of-the-art methods can lead to high memory and compute requirements. Since memory requirements are proportional to the product of domain dimensions, simulation performance is limited by memory access, as solvers for elliptic problems are not compute-bound on modern systems. This is a significant concern for large-scale scenes. To reduce the memory footprint and memory/compute ratio, vortex singularity bases can be used. Though they form a compact bases for incompressible vector fields, robust and efficient modeling of nonrigid obstacles and free-surfaces can be challenging with these methods. We propose a hybrid domain decomposition approach that couples Eulerian velocity-based simulations with vortex singularity simulations. Our formulation reduces memory footprint by using smaller Eulerian domains with compact vortex bases, thereby improving the memory/compute ratio, and simulation performance by more than 1000x for single phase flows as well as significant improvements for free-surface scenes. Coupling these two heterogeneous methods also affords flexibility in using the most appropriate method for modeling different scene features, as well as allowing robust interaction of vortex methods with free-surfaces and nonrigid obstacles.

 Wetting Effects in Hair Simulation  ##   Witawat Rungjiratananon, Yoshihiro Kanamori, Tomoyuki Nishita There is considerable recent progress in hair simulations, driven by the high demands in computer animated movies. However, capturing the complex interactions between hair and water is still relatively in its infancy. Such interactions are best modeled as those between water and an anisotropic permeable medium as water can flow into and out of the hair volume biased in hair fiber direction. Modeling the interaction is further challenged when the hair is allowed to move. In this paper, we introduce a simulation model that reproduces interactions between water and hair as a dynamic anisotropic permeable material. We utilize an Eulerian approach for capturing the microscopic porosity of hair and handle the wetting effects using a Cartesian bounding grid. A Lagrangian approach is used to simulate every single hair strand including interactions with each other, yielding fine-detailed dynamic hair simulation. Our model and simulation generate many interesting effects of interactions between fine-detailed dynamic hair and water, i.e., water absorption and diffusion, cohesion of wet hair strands, water flow within the hair volume, water dripping from the wet hair strands and morphological shape transformations of wet hair.

 Automated Constraint Placement to Maintain Pile Shape  ##   Shu-Wei Hsu, John Keyser We present a simulation control to support art-directable stacking designs by automatically adding constraints to stabilize the stacking structure. We begin by adapting equilibrium analysis in a local scheme to ﬁnd “stable” objects of the stacking structure. Next, for stabilizing the structure, we pick suitable objects from those passing the  equilibrium analysis and then restrict their DOFs by managing the insertion of constraints on them. The method is suitable for controlling stacking behavior of large scale. Results show that our control method can be used in varied ways for creating plausible animation. In addition, the method can be easily implemented as a plug-in into existing simulation solvers without changing the fundamental operations of the solvers.

 Speculative Parallel Asynchronous Contact Mechanics  ##   Samantha Ainsley, Etienne Vouga, Eitan Grinspun, Rasmus Tamstorf We extend the Asynchronous Contact Mechanics algorithm [Harmon et al. 2009] and improve its performance by two orders of magnitude, using only optimizations that do not compromise ACM’s three guarantees of safety, progress, and correctness. The key to this speedup is replacing ACM’s timid, forward-looking mechanism for detecting collisions—locating and rescheduling separating plane kinetic data structures—with an optimistic speculative method inspired by Mirtich’s rigid body Time Warp algorithm [2000]. Time warp allows us to perform collision detection over a window of time containing many of ACM’s asynchronous trajectory changes; in this way we cull away large intervals as being collision free. Moreover, by replacing force processing intermingled with KDS rescheduling by windows of pure processing followed by collision detection, we tranform an algorithm that is very difﬁcult to parallelize into one that is embarrassingly parallel.

 Interpenetration Free Simulation of Thin Shell Rigid Bodies  ##   R. Elliot English, Michael Lentine, Ron Fedkiw We propose a new algorithm for rigid body simulation that guarantees each body is in an interpenetration free state, both increasing the accuracy and robustness of the simulation as well as alleviating the need for ad hoc methods to separate bodies for subsequent simulation and rendering. We cleanly separate collision and contact resolution such that objects move and collide in the ﬁrst step, with resting contact handled in the second step. The ﬁrst step of our algorithm guarantees that each time step produces geometry that does not intersect or overlap by using an approximation to the continuous collision detection (and response) problem and thus is amenable to thin shells and degenerately ﬂat objects moving at high speeds. In addition we introduce a novel failsafe which allows us to resolve all interpenetration without iterating to convergence. Since the ﬁrst step guarantees a non-interfering state for the geometry, in the second step we propose a contact model for handling thin shells in proximity considering only the instantaneous locations at the ends of the time step.

 Geometric Numerical Integration of Inequality Constrained Nonsmooth Hamiltonian Systems  ##   Danny Kaufman, Dinesh Pai We consider the geometric numerical integration of Hamiltonian systems subject to both equality and “hard” inequality constraints. As in the standard geometric integration setting, we target long-term structure preservation. Additionally, however, we also consider invariant preservation over persistent, simultaneous, and/or frequent boundary interactions. Appropriately formulating geometric methods for these cases has long remained challenging due the inherent nonsmoothness and one-sided conditions that they impose. To resolve these issues we thus focus both on symplectic-momentum preserving behavior and the preservation of additional structures, unique to the inequality constrained setting. Toward these goals we introduce, for the first time, a fully nonsmooth, discrete Hamilton’s principle and obtain an associated framework for composing geometric numerical integration methods for inequality-equality–constrained systems. Applying this framework, we formulate a new family of geometric numerical integration methods that, by construction, preserve momentum and equality constraints and are observed to retain good long-term energy behavior. Along with these standard geometric properties, the derived methods also enforce multiple simultaneous inequality constraints, obtain smooth unilateral motion along constraint boundaries, and allow for both nonsmooth and smooth boundary approach and exit trajectories. Numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the behavior of these methods on difficult test examples where both smooth and nonsmooth active constraint modes persist with high frequency.

 An Efﬁcient Surface Reconstruction Pipeline for Particle-Based Fluids  ##   Gizem Akinci, Nadir Akinci, Markus Ihmsen, Matthias Teschner In this paper we present an efﬁcient surface reconstruction pipeline for particle-based ﬂuids such as smoothed particle hydrodynamics. After the scalar ﬁeld computation and the marching cubes based triangulation, we post process the surface mesh by applying surface decimation and subdivision algorithms. In comparison to existing approaches, the decimation step alleviates the particle alignment related bumpiness very efﬁciently and reduces the number of triangles in ﬂat regions. Later, the subdivision step ensures that the non-smooth regions are smoothed in a performance friendly way which allows our approach to run signiﬁcantly faster by using lower resolution marching cubes grids. The presented pipeline is applicable to particle position data sets in a frame by frame basis. Throughout the paper, we present both visual and performance comparisons with different parameter settings, and with a state-of-the-art surface reconstruction technique. Our results demonstrate that in comparison to other approaches with comparable surface quality, our pipeline runs 15 to 20 times faster with up to 80% less memory and secondary storage consumption.

 An implicit Tensor-Mass solver on the GPU for soft bodies simulation  ##   Xavier Faure, Florence Zara, Fabrice Jaillet, Jean-Michel Moreau The realistic and interactive simulation of deformable objects has become a challenge in Computer Graphics. In this paper, we propose a GPU implementation of the resolution of the mechanical equations, using a semi-implicit as well as an implicit integration scheme. At the contrary of the classical FEM approach, forces are directly computed at each node of the discretized objects, using the evaluation of the strain energy density of the elements. This approach allows to mix several mechanical behaviors in the same object. Results show a notable speedup of 30, especially in the case of complex scenes. Running times shows that this efficient implementation may contribute to make this model more popular for soft bodies simulations.

 Simulation of Complex Nonlinear Elastic Bodies using Lattice Deformers  ##   Taylor Patterson, Nathan Mitchell, Eftychios Sifakis Lattice deformers are a popular option for modeling the behavior of elastic bodies as they avoid the need for conforming mesh generation, and their regular structure offers signiﬁcant opportunities for performance optimizations. Our work expands the scope of current lattice-based elastic deformers, adding support for a number of important simulation features. We accommodate complex nonlinear, optionally anisotropic materials while using an economical one-point quadrature scheme. Our formulation fully accommodates near-incompressibility by enforcing accurate nonlinear constraints, supports implicit integration for large time steps, and is not susceptible to locking or poor conditioning of the discrete equations. Additionally, we increase the accuracy of our solver by employing a novel high-order quadrature scheme on lattice cells overlapping with the model boundary, which are treated at sub-cell precision. Finally, we detail how this accurate boundary treatment can be implemented at a minimal computational premium over the cost of a voxel-accurate discretization. We demonstrate our method in the simulation of complex musculoskeletal human models.

 Vega: Non-Linear FEM Deformable Object Simulator  ##   Fun Shing Sin, Daniel Schroeder, Jernej Barbic This practice and experience paper describes a robust C++ implementation of several non-linear solid three-dimensional deformable object strategies commonly employed in computer graphics, named the Vega finite element method (FEM) simulation library. Deformable models supported include co-rotational linear FEM elasticity, Saint–Venant Kirchhoff FEM model, mass–spring system and invertible FEM models: neo-Hookean, Saint–Venant Kirchhoff and Mooney–Rivlin. We provide several timestepping schemes, including implicit Newmark and backward Euler integrators, and explicit central differences. The implementation of material models is separated from integration, which makes it possible to employ our code not only for simulation, but also for deformable object control and shape modelling. We extensively compare the different material models and timestepping schemes.

 Lattice Cleaving: Conforming Tetrahedral Meshes of Multimaterial Domains with Bounded Quality  ##   Jonathan R. Bronson, Joshua A. Levine, Ross T.

The proposed method allows for an arbitrary number of materials, produces high-quality tetrahedral meshes with upper and lower bounds on dihedral angles, and guarantees geometric fidelity. Moreover, the method is combinatoric so its implementation enables rapid mesh construction. These meshes are structured in a way that also allows grading, in order to reduce element counts in regions of homogeneity.

 Simulating Liquids and Solid-Liquid Interaction with Lagrangian Meshes  ##   Pascal Clausen, Martin Wicke, Jonathan Shewchuk, James O’Brien This paper describes a Lagrangian finite element method that simulates the behavior of liquids and solids in a unified framework. Local mesh improvement operations maintain a high-quality tetrahedral discretization even as the mesh is advected by fluid flow. We conserve volume and momentum, locally and globally, by assigning each element an independent rest volume and adjusting it to correct for deviations during remeshing and collisions. Incompressibility is enforced with per-node pressure values, and extra degrees of freedom are selectively inserted to prevent pressure locking. Topological changes in the domain are explicitly treated with local mesh splitting and merging. Our method models surface tension with an implicit formulation based on surface energies computed on the boundary of the volume mesh. With this method we can model elastic, plastic, and liquid materials in a single mesh, with no need for explicit coupling. We also model heat diffusion and thermoelastic effects, which allow us to simulate phase changes. We demonstrate these capabilities in several fluid simulations at scales from millimeters to meters, including simulations of melting caused by external or thermoelastic heating.

 Artistic Simulation of Curly Hair  ##   Hayley Iben, Mark Meyer, Lena Petrovic, Olivier Soares, John Anderson, Andrew Witkin We present a novel method for stably simulating stylized curly hair that addresses artistic needs and performance demands, both found in the production of feature films. To satisfy the artistic requirement of maintaining the curl’s helical shape during motion, we propose a hair model based upon an extensible elastic rod. We introduce a novel method for stably computing a frame along the hair curve, essential for stable simulation of curly hair. Our hair model introduces a novel spring for controlling the bending of the curl and another for maintaining the helical shape during extension. We also address performance concerns often associated with handling hair-hair contact interactions by efficiently parallelizing the simulation. To do so, we present a novel algorithm for pruning both hair-hair contact pairs and hair particles. Our method is in use on a full length feature film and has proven to be robust and stable over a wide range of animated motion and on a variety of hair styles, from straight to wavy to curly.

 Closest Point Turbulence for Liquid Surfaces  ##   Theodore Kim, Jerry Tessendorf, Nils Thuerey We propose a method of increasing the apparent spatial resolution of an existing liquid simulation. Previous approaches to this “up-resing” problem have focused on increasing the turbulence of the underlying velocity field. Motivated by measurements in the free surface turbulence literature, we observe that past certain frequencies, it is sufficient to perform a wave simulation directly on the liquid surface, and construct a reduced-dimensional surface-only simulation. We sidestep the considerable problem of generating a surface parameterization by employing an embedding technique known as the Closest Point Method (CPM) that operates directly on a 3D extension field. The CPM requires 3D operators, and we show that for surface operators with no natural 3D generalization, it is possible to construct a viable operator using the inverse Abel transform. We additionally propose a fast,frozen core closest point transform, and an advection method for the extension field that reduces smearing considerably. Finally, we propose two turbulence coupling methods that seed the high resolution wave simulation in visually expected regions.

 Position-based Methods for the Simulation of Solid Objects in Computer Graphics  ##   Jan Bender, Matthias Müller, Miguel A. Otaduy and Matthias Teschner The dynamic simulation of solids has a long history in computer graphics. The classical methods in this field are based on the use of forces or impulses to simulate joints between rigid bodies as well as the stretching, shearing and bending stiffness of deformable objects. In the last years the class of position-based methods has become popular in the graphics community. These kinds of methods are fast, unconditionally stable and controllable which make them well-suited for the use in interactive environments. Position-based methods are not as accurate as force based methods in general but they provide visual plausibility. Therefore, the main application areas of these approaches are virtual reality, computer games and special effects in movies. This state of the art report covers the large variety of position-based methods that were developed in the field of deformable solids. We will introduce the concept of position-based dynamics, present dynamic simulation based on shape matching and discuss data-driven approaches. Furthermore, we will present several applications for these methods.

 Real-Time Fluid Effects on Surfaces using the Closest Point Method  ##   S. Auer, C. B. MacDonald, M. Treib, J. Schneider, R. Westermann The Closest Point Method (CPM) is a method for numerically solving partial differential equations (PDEs) on arbitrary surfaces, independent of the existence of a surface parametrization. The CPM uses a closest point representation of the surface, to solve the unmodified Cartesian version of a surface PDE in a 3D volume embedding, using simple and well-understood techniques. In this paper, we present the numerical solution of the wave equation and the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on surfaces via the CPM, and we demonstrate surface appearance and shape variations in real-time using this method. To fully exploit the potential of the CPM, we present a novel GPU realization of the entire CPM pipeline. We propose a surface-embedding adaptive 3D spatial grid for efficient representation of the surface, and present a high-performance approach using CUDA for converting surfaces given by triangulations into this representation. For real-time performance, CUDA is also used for the numerical procedures of the CPM. For rendering the surface (and the PDE solution) directly from the closest point representation without the need to reconstruct a triangulated surface, we present a GPU ray-casting method that works on the adaptive 3D grid.

 A Prediction-Correction Approach for Stable SPH Fluid Simulation from Liquid to Rigid  ##   Francois Dagenais, Jonathan Gagnon, Eric Paquette The simulation of highly viscous fluids using an SPH (Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics) approach is a tedious task. Since the equations are typically posed as stiff problems, simulating highly viscous fluids involves strong forces applied to the particles. With these strong forces, a very small time step is needed to keep the simulation stable and produce good results. The approach detailed in this paper uses an iterative prediction-correction scheme to optimize forces that act on the fluid, in order to produce a behavior that varies from liquid to solid. This approach significantly reduces the computation times when the fluid is very viscous and almost rigid. At every time step, each particle position is predicted. The deformation is then compared with a target deformation and forces are adjusted to counteract the deformation. In addition to requiring lengthy computation times and tedious adjustment of time step to maintain a stable simulation, typical SPH simulators make it difficult to achieve the desired behavior. This difficulty is caused by the highly non-linear effect that the viscosity has on the behavior of the fluid. Compared to the typical viscosity parameter which varies from zero to infinity, the proposed rigidity parameter is easier to control, providing an intuitive variation from 0 (liquid) to 1 (solid). Since simulating high viscosity fluids is subject to large computation times and instabilities, we complement the proposed model with some important improvements. Firstly, an improved time step adjustment is proposed that results in both reduced computation times and increased stability. Secondly, an implicit temperature diffusion provides stable melting and solidification, regardless of the size of the time step. Thirdly, a constraint propagation provides faster convergence of the rigid forces to visually realistic behaviors. Together, these improvements and the proposed model allow the simulation of fluids with viscous behaviors that were very difficult, if not impossible, to simulate with current SPH approaches.

 Fast Simulation of Inextensible Hair and Fur  ##   Matthias Mueller, Tae-Young Kim, Nuttapong Chentanez In this short paper we focus on the fast simulation of hair and fur on animated characters. While it is common in films to simulate single hair strands on virtual humans and on furry animals, those features are either not present on characters in computer games or modeled with simplified textured meshes. The main difficulty of simulating hair in real time applications is the sheer number of hair strands and the fact that each hair is inextensible. Keeping thousands of deformable objects from being stretched is computationally expensive. In this paper, we present a robust method for simulating hair and fur that guarantees inextensiblity with a single iteration per frame. For an iteration count this low, existing methods either become unstable or introduce a substantial amount of stretching. Our method is geometric in nature and able to simulate thousands of inextensible hair strands in real time.

 Eulerian-on-Lagrangian Simulation  ##   Ye Fan, Joshua Litven, David I.W. Levin, Dinesh K. Pai We describe an Eulerian-on-Lagrangian solid simulator that reduces or eliminates many of the problems experienced by fully Eulerian methods but retains its advantages. Our method does not require the construction of an explicit object discretization and the fixed nature of the simulation mesh avoids tangling during large deformations. By introducing Lagrangian modes to the simulation we enable unbounded simulation domains and reduce the time-step restrictions which can plague Eulerian simulations. Our method features a new solver that can resolve contact between multiple objects while simultaneously distributing motion between the Lagrangian and Eulerian modes in a least-squares fashion. Our method successfully bridges the gap between Lagrangian and Eulerian simulation methodologies without having to abandon either one.

 Near-exhaustive Precomputation of Secondary Cloth Effects  ##   Doyub Kim, Woojong Koh, Rahul Narain, Kayvon Fatahalian, Adrien Treuille, James F. O’Brien The central argument against data-driven methods in computer graphics rests on the curse of dimensionality: it is intractable to precompute “everything” about a complex space. In this paper, we challenge that assumption by using several thousand CPU-hours to perform a massive exploration of the space of secondary clothing effects on a character animated through a large motion graph. Our system continually explores the phase space of cloth dynamics, incrementally constructing a secondary cloth motion graph that captures the dynamics of the system. We find that it is possible to sample the dynamical space to a low visual error tolerance and that secondary motion graphs containing tens of gigabytes of raw mesh data can be compressed down to only tens of megabytes. These results allow us to capture the effect of high-resolution, off-line cloth simulation for a rich space of character motion and deliver it efficiently as part of an interactive application.

 Folding and Crumpling Adaptive Sheets  ##   Rahul Narain, Tobias Pfaff, and James F. O’Brien We present a technique for simulating plastic deformation in sheets of thin materials, such as crumpled paper, dented metal, and wrinkled cloth. Our simulation uses a framework of adaptive mesh refinement to dynamically align mesh edges with folds and creases. This framework allows efficient modeling of sharp features and avoids bend locking that would be otherwise caused by stiff in-plane behavior. By using an explicit plastic embedding space we prevent remeshing from causing shape diffusion. We include several examples demonstrating that the resulting method realistically simulates the behavior of thin sheets as they fold and crumple.

 Liquid Surface Tracking with Error Compensation  ##   Morten Bojsen-Hansen, Chris Wojtan Our work concerns the combination of an Eulerian liquid simulation with a high-resolution surface tracker (e.g. the level set method or a Lagrangian triangle mesh). The naive application of a high-resolution surface tracker to a low-resolution velocity field can produce many visually disturbing physical and topological artifacts that limit their use in practice. We address these problems by defining an error function which compares the current state of the surface tracker to the set of physically valid surface states. By reducing this error with a gradient descent technique, we introduce a novel physics-based surface fairing method. Similarly, by treating this error function as a potential energy, we derive a new surface correction force that mimics the vortex sheet equations. We demonstrate our results with both level set and mesh-based surface trackers.

 Interactive Authoring of Simulation-Ready Plants  ##   Yili Zhao, Jernej Barbič Physically based simulation can produce quality motion of plants, but requires an authoring stage to convert plant “polygon soup” triangle meshes to a format suitable for physically based simulation. We give a system that can author complex simulation-ready plants in a manner of minutes. Our system decomposes the plant geometry, establishes a hierarchy, builds and connects simulation meshes, and detects instances. It scales to anatomically realistic geometry of adult plants, is robust to non-manifold input geometry, gaps between branches or leaves, free-flying leaves not connected to any branch, spurious geometry, and plant self-collisions in the in- put configuration. We demonstrate the results using a FEM model reduction simulator that can compute large-deformation dynamics of complex plants at interactive rates, subject to user forces, gravity or randomized wind. We also provide plant fracture (with pre-specified patterns), inverse kinematics to easily pose plants, as well as interactive design of plant material properties. We authored and simulated over 100 plants from diverse climates and geographic regions, including broadleaf (deciduous) trees and conifers, bushes and flowers. Our largest simulations involve anatomically realistic adult trees with hundreds of branches and over 100,000 leaves.

 Robust Inside-Outside Segmentation using Generalized Winding Numbers  ##   Alec Jacobson, Ladislav Kavan, Olga Sorkine-Hornung Solid shapes in computer graphics are often represented with boundary descriptions, e.g. triangle meshes, but animation, physically-based simulation, and geometry processing are more realistic and accurate when explicit volume representations are available. Tetrahedral meshes which exactly contain (interpolate) the input boundary description are desirable but difficult to construct for a large class of input meshes. Character meshes and CAD models are often composed of many connected components with numerous self-intersections, non-manifold pieces, and open boundaries, precluding existing meshing algorithms. We propose an automatic algorithm handling all of these issues, resulting in a compact discretization of the input’s inner volume. We only require reasonably consistent orientation of the input triangle mesh. By generalizing the winding number for arbitrary triangle meshes, we define a function that is a perfect segmentation for watertight input and is well-behaved otherwise. This function guides a graphcut segmentation of a constrained Delaunay tessellation (CDT), providing a minimal description that meets the boundary exactly and may be fed as input to existing tools to achieve element quality. We highlight our robustness on a number of examples and show applications of solving PDEs, volumetric texturing and elastic simulation.

 Real-Time Dynamic Fracture with Volumetric Approximate Convex Decompositions  ##   Matthias Mueller, Nuttapong Chentanez, Tae-Yong Kim We propose a new fast, robust and controllable method to simulate the dynamic destruction of large and complex objects in real time. The common method for fracture simulation in computer games is to pre-fracture models and replace objects by their pre-computed parts at run-time. This popular method is computationally cheap but has the disadvantages that the fracture pattern does not align with the impact location and that the number of hierarchical fracture levels is fixed. Our method allows dynamic fracturing of large objects into an unlimited number of pieces fast enough to be used in computer games. We represent visual meshes by volumetric approximate convex decompositions (VACD) and apply user-defined fracture patterns dependent on the impact location. The method supports partial fracturing meaning that fracture patterns can be applied locally at multiple locations of an object. We propose new methods for computing a VACD, for approximate convex hull construction and for detecting islands in the convex decomposition after partial destruction in order to determine support structures.

 Position Based Fluids  ##   Miles Macklin, Matthias Müller In fluid simulation, enforcing incompressibility is crucial for realism; it is also computationally expensive. Recent work has improved efficiency, but still requires time-steps that are impractical for real-time applications. In this work we present an iterative density solver integrated into the Position Based Dynamics framework (PBD). By formulating and solving a set of positional constraints that enforce constant density, our method allows similar incompressibility and convergence to modern smoothed particle hydrodynamic (SPH) solvers, but inherits the stability of the geometric, position based dynamics method, allowing large time steps suitable for real-time applications. We incorporate an artificial pressure term that improves particle distribution, creates surface tension, and lowers the neighborhood requirements of traditional SPH. Finally, we address the issue of energy loss by applying vorticity confinement as a velocity post process.

 Non-Polynomial Galerkin Projection on Deforming Meshes  ##   Matt Stanton, Yu Sheng, Martin Wicke, Federico Perazzi, Amos Yuen, Srinivasa Narasimhan, Adrien Treuille This paper extends Galerkin projection to a large class of non-polynomial functions typically encountered in graphics. We demonstrate the broad applicability of our approach by applying it to two strikingly different problems: fluid simulation and radiosity rendering, both using deforming meshes. Standard Galerkin projection cannot efficiently approximate these phenomena. Our approach, by contrast, enables the compact representation and approximation of these complex non-polynomial systems, including quotients and roots of polynomials. We rely on representing each function to be model-reduced as a composition of tensor products, matrix inversions, and matrix roots. Once a function has been represented in this form, it can be easily model-reduced, and its reduced form can be evaluated with time and memory costs dependent only on the dimension of the reduced space.

 A Two-Continua Approach to Eulerian Simulation of Water Spray  ##   Michael B. Nielsen, Ole Osterby Physics based simulation of the dynamics of water spray – water droplets dispersed in air – is a means to increase the visual plausibility of computer graphics modeled phenomena such as waterfalls, water jets and stormy seas. Spray phenomena are frequently encountered by the visual effects industry and often challenge state of the art methods. Current spray simulation pipelines typically employ a combination of Lagrangian (particle) and Eulerian (volumetric) methods – the Eulerian methods being used for parts of the spray where individual droplets are not apparent. However, existing Eulerian methods in computer graphics are based on gas solvers that will for example exhibit hydrostatic equilibrium in certain scenarios where the air is expected to rise and the water droplets fall. To overcome this problem, we propose to simulate spray in the Eulerian domain as a two-way coupled two-continua of air and water phases co-existing at each point in space. The fundamental equations originate in applied physics and we present a number of contributions that make Eulerian two-continua spray simulation feasible for computer graphics applications. The contributions include a Poisson equation that fits into the operator splitting methodology as well as (semi-)implicit discretizations of droplet diffusion and the drag force with improved stability properties. As shown by several examples, our approach allows us to more faithfully capture the dynamics of spray than previous Eulerian methods.

 Highly Adaptive Liquid Simulations on Tetrahedral Meshes  ##   Ryoichi Ando, Nils Thürey and Chris Wojtan We introduce a new method for efficiently simulating liquid with extreme amounts of spatial adaptivity. Our method combines several key components to drastically speed up the simulation of large-scale fluid phenomena: We leverage an alternative Eulerian tetrahedral mesh discretization to significantly reduce the complexity of the pressure solve while increasing the robustness with respect to element quality and removing the possibility of locking. Next, we enable subtle free-surface phenomena by deriving novel second-order boundary conditions consistent with our discretization. We couple this discretization with a spatially adaptive Fluid-Implicit Particle (FLIP) method, enabling efficient, robust, minimally-dissipative simulations that can undergo sharp changes in spatial resolution while minimizing artifacts. Along the way, we provide a new method for generating a smooth and detailed surface from a set of particles with variable sizes. Finally, we explore several new sizing functions for determining spatially adaptive simulation resolutions, and we show how to couple them to our simulator. We combine each of these elements to produce a simulation algorithm that is capable of creating animations at high maximum resolutions while avoiding common pitfalls like inaccurate boundary conditions and inefficient computation.

 Modeling Friction and Air Effects between Cloth and Deformable Bodies  ##   Zhili Chen, Renguo Feng, Huamin Wang Real-world cloth exhibits complex behaviors when it contacts deformable bodies. In this paper, we study how to improve the simulation of cloth-body interactions from three perspectives: collision, friction, and air pressure. We propose an efficient and robust algorithm to detect the collisions between cloth and deformable bodies, using the surface traversal technique. We develop a friction measurement device and we use it to capture frictional data from real-world experiments. The derived friction model can realistically handle complex friction properties of cloth, including anisotropy and nonlinearity. To produce pressure effects caused by the air between cloth and deformable bodies, we define an air mass field on the cloth layer and we use real-world air permeability data to animate it over time. Our results demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of our system in simulating objects with a three-layer structure (i.e., a cloth layer, an air layer, and an inner body layer), such as pillows, comforters, down jackets, and stuffed toys.

 Adaptive Fracture Simulation of Multi-Layered Thin Plates  ##   Oleksiy Busaryev, Tamal K. Dey, Huamin Wang The fractures of thin plates often exhibit complex physical behaviors in the real world. In particular, fractures caused by tearing are different from fractures caused by in-plane motions. In this paper, we study how to make thin-plate fracture animations more realistic from three perspectives. We propose a stress relaxation method, which is applied to avoid shattering artifacts after generating each fracture cut. We formulate a fracture-aware remeshing scheme based on constrained Delaunay triangulation, to adaptively provide more fracture details. Finally, we use our multi-layered model to simulate complex fracture behaviors across thin layers. Our experiment shows that the system can efficiently and realistically simulate the fractures of multi-layered thin plates.

 Super Space Clothoids  ##   Romain Casati, Florence Bertails-Descoubes Thin elastic filaments in real world such as vine tendrils, hair ringlets or curled ribbons often depict a very smooth, curved shape that low-order rod models — e.g., segment-based rods — fail to reproduce accurately and compactly. In this paper, we push forward the investigation of high-order models for thin, inextensible elastic rods by building the dynamics of a G2-continuous piecewise 3D clothoid: a smooth space curve with piecewise affine curvature. With the aim of precisely integrating the rod kinematic problem, for which no closed-form solution exists, we introduce a dedicated integration scheme based on power series expansions. It turns out that our algorithm reaches machine precision orders of magnitude faster compared to classical numerical integrators. This property, nicely preserved under simple algebraic and differential operations, allows us to compute all spatial terms of the rod kinematics and dynamics in both an efficient and accurate way. Combined with a semi-implicit time-stepping scheme, our method leads to the efficient and robust simulation of arbitrary curly filaments that exhibit rich, visually pleasing configurations and motion. Our approach was successfully applied to generate various scenarios such as the unwinding of a curled ribbon as well as the aesthetic animation of spiral-like hair or the fascinating growth of twining plants.

 Synthetic Controllable Turbulence Using Robust Second Vorticity Confinement  ##   Shengfeng He, Rynson W. H. Lau Capturing fine details of turbulence on a coarse grid is one of the main tasks in real-time fluid simulation. Existing methods for doing this have various limitations. In this paper, we propose a new turbulence method that uses a refined Second Vorticity Confinement method, referred to as Robust Second Vorticity Confinement, and a synthesis scheme to create highly turbulent effects from coarse grid. The new technique is sufficiently stable to efficiently produce highly turbulent flows, while allowing intuitive control of vortical structures. Second Vorticity Confinement captures and defines the vortical features of turbulence on a coarse grid. However, due to the stability problem, it cannot be used to produce highly turbulent flows. In this work, we propose a robust formulation to improve the stability problem by making the positive diffusion term to vary with helicity adaptively. In addition, we also employ our new method to procedurally synthesize the high resolution flow fields. As shown in our results, this approach produces stable high resolution turbulence very efficiently.

 Efficient GPU data structures and methods to solve sparse linear systems in dynamics applications  ##   Daniel Weber, Jan Bender, Markus Schnoes, Andre Stork and Dieter Fellner We present GPU data structures and algorithms to efficiently solve sparse linear systems which are typically required in simulations of multibody systems and deformable bodies. Thereby, we introduce an efficient sparse matrix data structure that can handle arbitrary sparsity patterns and outperforms current state-of-the-art implementations for sparse matrix vector multiplication. Moreover, an efficient method to construct global matrices on the GPU is presented where hundreds of thousands of individual element contributions are assembled in a few milliseconds. A finite element based method for the simulation of deformable solids as well as an impulse-based method for rigid bodies are introduced in order to demonstrate the advantages of the novel data structures and algorithms. These applications share the characteristic that a major computational effort consists of building and solving systems of linear equations in every time step.

 Embedded Thin Shells for Wrinkle Simulation  ##   Olivier Remillard, Paul G. Kry We present a new technique for simulating high resolution surface wrinkling deformations of composite objects consisting of a soft interior and a harder skin. We combine high resolution thin shells with coarse finite element lattices and define frequency based constraints that allow the formation of wrinkles with properties matching those predicted by the physical parameters of the composite object. Our two-way coupled model produces the expected wrinkling behavior without the computational expense of a large number of volumetric elements to model deformations under the surface. We use C1 quadratic shape functions for the interior deformations, allowing very coarse resolutions to model the overall global deformation efficiently, while avoiding visual artifacts of wrinkling at discretization boundaries. We demonstrate that our model produces wrinkle wavelengths that match both theoretical predictions and high resolution volumetric simulations. We also show example applications in simulating wrinkles on passive objects, such as furniture, and for wrinkles on faces in character animation.

 Subspace Fluid Re-Simulation  ##   Theodore Kim, John Delaney We present a new subspace integration method that is capable of efficiently adding and subtracting dynamics from an existing high-resolution fluid simulation. We show how to analyze the results of an existing high-resolution simulation, discover an efficient reduced approximation, and use it to quickly “re-simulate” novel variations of the original dynamics. Prior subspace methods have had difficulty re-simulating the original input dynamics because they lack efficient means of handling semi-Lagrangian advection methods. We show that multi-dimensional cubature schemes can be applied to this and other advection methods, such as MacCormack advection. The remaining pressure and diffusion stages can be written as a single matrix-vector multiply, so as with previous subspace methods, no matrix inversion is needed at runtime. We additionally propose a novel importance sampling-based fitting algorithm that asymptotically accelerates the precomputation stage, and show that the Iterated Orthogonal Projection method can be used to elegantly incorporate moving internal boundaries into a subspace simulation. In addition to efficiently producing variations of the original input, our method can produce novel, abstract fluid motions that we have not seen from any other solver.

 Chimera Grids for Water Simulation  ##   R. Elliot English, Linhai Qiu, Yue Yu, Ronald Fedkiw We introduce a new method for large scale water simulation using Chimera grid embedding, which discretizes space with overlapping Cartesian grids that translate and rotate in order to decompose the domain into different regions of interest with varying spatial resolutions. Grids can track both fluid features and solid objects, allowing for dynamic spatial adaptivity without remeshing or repartitioning the domain. We solve the inviscid incompressible NavierStokes equations with an arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian style semiLagrangian advection scheme and a monolithic SPD Poisson solver. We modify the particle level set method in order to adapt it to Chimera grids including particle treatment across grid boundaries with disparate cell sizes, and strategies to deal with locality in the implementation of the level set and fast marching algorithms. We use a local Voronoi mesh construction to solve for pressure and address a number of issues that arise with the treatment of the velocity near the interface. The resulting method is highly scalable on distributed parallel architectures with minimal communication costs.

 A Hybrid Lagrangian-Eulerian Formulation for Bubble Generation and Dynamics  ##   Saket Patkar, Mridul Aanjaneya, Dimitriy Karpman, Ronald Fedkiw We present a hybrid Lagrangian-Eulerian framework for simulating both small and large scale bubble dynamics, where the bubbles can grow or shrink in volume as dictated by pressure forces in the surrounding fluid. Small under-resolved bubbles are evolved using Lagrangian particles that are monolithically two-way coupled to the surrounding flow in a manner that closely approximates the analytic bubble oscillation frequency while converging to the analytic volume as predicted by the well-known Rayleigh-Plesset equation. We present a novel scheme for interconverting between these under-resolved Lagrangian bubbles and larger well-resolved bubbles that are modeled with a traditional Eulerian level set approach. We also present a novel seeding mechanism to realistically generate bubbles when simulating fluid structure interaction with complex objects such as ship propellers. Moreover, our framework for bubble generation is general enough to be incorporated into all grid-based as well as particle-based fluid simulation methods.

 Thin Skin Elastodynamics  ##   Duo Li, Shinjiro Sueda, Debanga R. Neog, Dinesh K. Pai We present a novel approach to simulating thin hyperelastic skin. Real human skin is only a few millimeters thick. It can stretch and slide over underlying body structures such as muscles, bones, and tendons, revealing rich details of a moving character. Simulating such skin is challenging because it is in close contact with the body and shares its geometry. Despite major advances in simulating elastodynamics of cloth and soft bodies for computer graphics, such methods are difficult to use for simulating thin skin due to the need to deal with non-conforming meshes, collision detection, and contact response. We propose a novel Eulerian representation of skin that avoids all the difficulties of constraining the skin to lie on the body surface by working directly on the surface itself. Skin is modeled as a 2D hyperelastic membrane with arbitrary topology, which makes it easy to cover an entire character or object. Unlike most Eulerian simulations, we do not require a regular grid and can use triangular meshes to model body and skin geometry. The method is easy to implement, and can use low resolution meshes to animate high resolution details stored in texture-like maps. Skin movement is driven by the animation of body shape prescribed by an artist or by another simulation, and so it can be easily added as a post-processing stage to an existing animation pipeline. We provide several examples simulating human and animal skin, and skin-tight clothes.

 Subspace Integration with Local Deformations  ##   David Harmon, Denis Zorin Subspace techniques greatly reduce the cost of nonlinear simulation by approximating deformations with a small custom basis. In order to represent the deformations well (in terms of a global metric), the basis functions usually have global support, and cannot capture localized deformations. While reduced-space basis functions can be localized to some extent, capturing truly local deformations would still require a very large number of precomputed basis functions, significantly degrading both precomputation and online performance. We present an efficient approach to handling local deformations that cannot be predicted, most commonly arising from contact and collisions, by augmenting the subspace basis with custom functions derived from analytic solutions to static loading problems. We also present a new cubature scheme designed to facilitate fast computation of the necessary runtime quantities while undergoing a changing basis. Our examples yield a two order of magnitude speedup over full-coordinate simulations, striking a desirable balance between runtime speeds and expressive ability.

 Efficient Simulation of Secondary Motion in Rig-Space  ##   Fabian Hahn, Bernhard Thomaszewski, Stelian Coros, Sebastian Martin, Robert Sumner, Markus Gross We present an efficient method for augmenting keyframed character animations with physically-simulated secondary motion. Our method achieves a performance improvement of one to two orders of magnitude over previous work without compromising on quality. This performance is based on a linearized formulation of rig-space dynamics that uses only rig parameters as degrees of freedom, a physics-based volumetric skinning method that allows our method to predict the motion of internal vertices solely from deformations of the surface, as well as a deferred Jacobian update scheme that drastically reduces the number of required rig evaluations. We demonstrate the performance of our method by comparing it to previous work and showcase its potential on a production-quality character rig.

 A Level Set Method for Ductile Fracture  ##   Jan Hegemann, Chenfanfu Jiang, Craig Schroeder, Joseph M. Teran We utilize the shape derivative of the classical Griffith’s energy in a level set method for the simulation of dynamic ductile fracture. The level set is defined in the undeformed configuration of the object, and its evolution is designed to represent a transition from undamaged to failed material. No re-meshing is needed since the resulting topological changes are handled naturally by the level set method. We provide a new mechanism for the generation of fragments of material during the progression of the level set in the Griffith’s energy minimization. Collisions between different material pieces are resolved with impulses derived from the material point method over a background Eulerian grid. This provides a stable means for colliding with embedded interfaces. Simulation of corotational elasticity is based on an implicit finite element discretization.

 Course: Turbulent Fluids  ##   Tobias Pfaff, Nils Thuerey, Theodore Kim Over the last decade, the special effects industry has embraced physics simulations as a highly useful tool for creating realistic scenes ranging from a small camp fire to the large scale destruction of whole cities. While fluid simulations are now widely used in the industry, it remains inherently difficult to control large scale simulations, and there is an constant struggle for increasing visual detail. In this course, we will tackle these problems using turbulence methods. Turbulent detail is what makes typical fluid simulations look impressive, and the underlying physics motivate a powerful approach for control: they allow for an elegant split of large scale motion and small scale turbulent detail. This results in a two-stage work flow that is highly convenient for artists: first, a rough, and fast initial simulation is performed, which is then turned into a more detailed one by adding turbulent effects. This course aims at giving an overview and providing practical guide to employing turbulence modeling techniques for fluid simulations in computer graphics. After reviewing the basics of fluid solvers, and the popular wavelet turbulence approach, we will present several powerful methods to capture advanced effects such as boundary layers, and turbulence with directional preferences. In addition, the difficulties of liquid simulations will be explained, and an approach for liquid turbulence that is based on wave dynamics will be presented.

 A Material Point Method for Snow Simulation  ##   Alexey Stomakhin, Craig Schroeder, Lawrence Chai, Joseph Teran, Andrew Selle Snow is a challenging natural phenomenon to visually simulate. While the graphics community has previously considered accumulation and rendering of snow, animation of snow dynamics has not been fully addressed. Additionally, existing techniques for solids and ﬂuids have difﬁculty producing convincing snow results. Speciﬁcally, wet or dense snow that has both solid- and ﬂuid-like properties is difﬁcult to handle. Consequently, this paper presents a novel snow simulation method utilizing a usercontrollable elasto-plastic constitutive model integrated with a hybrid Eulerian/Lagrangian Material Point Method. The method is continuum based and its hybrid nature allows us to use a regular Cartesian grid to automate treatment of self-collision and fracture. It also naturally allows us to derive a grid-based semi-implicit integration scheme that has conditioning independent of the number of Lagrangian particles. We demonstrate the power of our method with a variety of snow phenomena including complex character interactions.

 Efficient Penetration Depth Approximation using Active Learning  ##   Jia Pan, Xinyu Zhang, Dinesh Manocha We present a new method for efficiently computing the global penetration depth between two rigid objects using machine learning techniques. Our approach consists of two phases: offline learning and performing run-time queries. In the learning phase, we pre-compute an approximation of the contact space of a pair of intersecting objects from a set of samples in the configuration space. We use active and incremental learning algorithms to accelerate the pre-computation and improve the accuracy. During the run-time phase, our algorithm performs a nearest-neighbor query based on translational or rotational distance metrics. The run-time query has a small overhead and computes an approximation to global penetration depth in a few milliseconds. We use our algorithm for collision response computations in Box2D and Bullet game physics engines and observe more than an order of magnitude improvement over prior PD computation techniques.

 Fast Simulation of Mass-Spring Systems  ##   Tiantian Liu, Adam Bargteil, James F. O’Brien, Ladislav Kavan We describe a scheme for time integration of mass-spring systems that makes use of a solver based on block coordinate descent. This scheme provides a fast solution for classical linear (Hookean) springs. We express the widely used implicit Euler method as an energy minimization problem and introduce spring directions as auxiliary unknown variables. The system is globally linear in the node positions, and the non-linear terms involving the directions are strictly local. Because the global linear system does not depend on run-time state, the matrix can be pre-factored, allowing for very fast iterations. Our method converges to the same final result as would be obtained by solving the standard form of implicit Euler using Newton’s method. Although the asymptotic convergence of Newton’s method is faster than ours, the initial ratio of work to error reduction with our method is much faster than Newton’s. For real-time visual applications, where speed and stability are more important than precision, we obtain visually acceptable results at a total cost per timestep that is only a fraction of that required for a single Newton iteration. When higher accuracy is required, our algorithm can be used to compute a good starting point for subsequent Newton’s iteration.

 Physics-Based Animation of Large-scale Splashing Liquids  ##   Dan Gerzewski, Adam Bargteil Fluid simulation has been one of the greatest successes of physics-based animation, generating hundreds of research papers and a great many special effects over the last fifteen years.

 Inverse Dynamic Hair Modeling with Frictional Contact  ##   Alexandre Derouet-Jourdan, Florence Bertails-Descoubes, Gilles Daviet, Joelle Thollot In the latest years, considerable progress has been achieved for accurately acquiring the geometry of human hair, thus largely improving the realism of virtual characters. In parallel, rich and robust physics-based simulators have been successfully designed to capture the intricate dynamics of hair due to contact and friction. However, at the moment there exists no consistent pipeline for converting a given hair geometry into a realistic physics-based hair model. Current approaches simply initialize the hair simulator with the input geometry in the absence of external forces. This results in an undesired sagging effect when the dynamic simulation is started, which basically ruins all the efforts put into the accurate design and/or capture of the input hairstyle. In this paper we propose the first method which consistently and robustly accounts for surrounding forces — gravity and frictional contacts, including hair self-contacts — when converting a geometric hairstyle into a physics-based hair model. Taking an arbitrary hair geometry as input together with a corresponding body mesh, we interpret the hair shape as a static equilibrium configuration of a hair simulator, in the presence of gravity as well as hair-body and hair-hair frictional contacts. Assuming hair parameters are homogeneous and lie in a plausible range of physical values, we show that this large, underdetermined inverse problem can be formulated as a well-posed constrained optimization problem, which can be robustly and efficiently solved by leveraging the frictional contact solver of the direct hair simulator. Our method was successfully applied to the animation of various hair geometries, ranging from synthetic hairstyles manually designed by an artist to the most recent human hair data reconstructed from capture.

 An Efficient Construction of Reduced Deformable Objects  ##   Christoph von Tycowicz, Christian Schulz, Hans-Peter Seidel, Klaus Hildebrandt Many efficient computational methods for physical simulation are based on model reduction. We propose new model reduction techniques for the approximation of reduced forces and for the construction of reduced shape spaces of deformable objects that accelerate the construction of a reduced dynamical system, increase the accuracy of the approximation, and simplify the implementation of model reduction. Based on the techniques, we introduce schemes for real-time simulation of deformable objects and interactive deformation-based editing of triangle or tet meshes.

 Spatio-temporal Extrapolation for Fluid Animation  ##   Yubo Zhang, Kwan-Liu Ma We introduce a novel spatio-temporal extrapolation technique for ﬂuid simulation designed to improve the results without using higher resolution simulation grids. In general, there are rigid demands associated with pushing ﬂuid animations to higher resolutions given limited computational capabilities. This results in tradeoffs between implementing high-order numerical methods and increasing the resolution of the simulation in space and time. For 3D problems, such challenges rapidly become cost-ineffective. The extrapolation method we present improves the ﬂow features without using higher resolution simulation grids. In this paper, we show that simulation results from our extrapolation are comparable to those from higher resolution simulations. In addition, our method differs from high-order numerical methods because it does not depend on the equation or speciﬁc solver. We demonstrate that it is easy to implement and can signiﬁcantly improve the ﬂuid animation results.

Otaduy Force-deformation measurements of cloth exhibit signiﬁcant hysteresis, and many researchers have identiﬁed internal friction as the source of this effect. However, it has not been incorporated into computer animation models of cloth. In this paper, we propose a model of internal friction based on an augmented reparameterization of Dahl’s model, and we show that this model provides a good match to several important features of cloth hysteresis even with a minimal set of parameters. We also propose novel parameter estimation procedures that are based on simple and inexpensive setups and need only sparse data, as opposed to the complex hardware and dense data acquisition of previous methods.

 Implicit Integration for Particle-based Simulation of Elasto-plastic Solids  ##   Yahan Zhou, Zhaoliang Lun, Evangelos Kalogerakis, Rui Wang We present a novel particle-based method for stable simulation of elasto-plastic materials. The main contribution of our method is an implicit numerical integrator, using a physically-based model, for computing particles that undergo both elastic and plastic deformations. The main advantage of our implicit integrator is that it allows the use of large time steps while still preserving stable and physically plausible simulation results. As a key component of our algorithm, at each time step we compute the particle positions and velocities based on a sparse linear system, which we solve efficiently on the graphics hardware. Compared to existing techniques, our method allows for a much wider range of stiffness and plasticity settings. In addition, our method can significantly reduce the computation cost for certain range of material types. We demonstrate fast and stable simulations for a variety of elasto-plastic materials, ranging from highly stiff elastic materials to highly plastic ones.

 Automatic Construction of Coarse, High-Quality Tetrahedralizations that  Enclose and Approximate Surfaces for Animation  ##   David A. Stuart, Joshua A. Levine, Ben Jones, Adam Bargteil Embedding high-resolution surface geometry in coarse control meshes is a standard approach to achieving high-quality computer animation at low computational expense. In this paper we present an effective, automatic method for generating such control meshes. The resulting high-quality, tetrahedral meshes enclose and approximate an input surface mesh, avoiding extrapolation artifacts and ensuring that the resulting coarse volumetric meshes are adequate collision proxies. Our approach comprises three steps: we begin with a tetrahedral mesh built from the body-centered cubic lattice that tessellates the bounding box of the input surface; we then perform a sculpting phase that carefully removes elements from the lattice; and finally a variational vertex adjustment phase iteratively adjusts vertex positions to more closely approximate the surface geometry. Our approach provides explicit trade-offs between mesh quality, resolution, and surface approximation. Our experiments demonstrate the technique can be used to build high-quality meshes appropriate for simulations within games.

 Interactive Localized Liquid Motion Editing  ##   Zherong Pan, Jin Huang, Yiying Tong, Changxi Zheng, and Hujun Bao Animation techniques for controlling liquid simulation are challenging: they commonly require carefully setting initial and boundary conditions or performing a costly numerical optimization scheme against user-provided keyframes or animation sequences. Either way, the whole process is laborious and computationally expensive. We introduce a novel method to provide intuitive and interactive control of liquid simulation. Our method enables a user to locally edit selected keyframes and automatically propagates the editing in a nearby temporal region using geometric deformation. We formulate our local editing techniques as a small-scale nonlinear optimization problem which can be solved interactively. With this uniformed formulation, we propose three editing metaphors, including (i) sketching local fluid features using a few user strokes, (ii) dragging a local fluid region, and (iii) controlling a local shape with a small mesh patch. Finally, we use the edited liquid animation to guide an of offline high-resolution simulation to recover more surface details. We demonstrate the intuitiveness and efficacy of our method in various practical scenarios.

 Versatile Surface Tension and Adhesion for SPH Fluids  ##   Nadir Akinci, Gizem Akinci, Matthias Teschner Realistic handling of fluid-air and fluid-solid interfaces in SPH is a challenging problem. The main reason is that some important physical phenomena such as surface tension and adhesion emerge as a result of inter-molecular forces in a microscopic scale. This is different from scalar fields such as fluid pressure, which can be plausibly evaluated on a macroscopic scale using particles. Although there exist techniques to address this problem for some specific simulation scenarios, there does not yet exist a general approach to reproduce the variety of effects that emerge in reality from fluid air and fluid-solid interactions. In order to address this problem, we present a new surface tension force and a new adhesion force. Different from the existing work, our surface tension force can handle large surface tensions in a realistic way. This property lets our approach handle challenging real scenarios, such as water crown formation, various types of fluid-solid interactions, and even droplet simulations. Furthermore, it prevents particle clustering at the free surface where inter-particle pressure forces are incorrect. Our adhesion force allows plausible two-way attraction of fluids and solids and can be used to model different wetting conditions. By using our forces, modeling surface tension and adhesion effects do not require involved techniques such as generating a ghost air phase or surface tracking. The forces are applied to the neighboring fluidfluid and fluid-boundary particle pairs in a symmetric way, which satisfies momentum conservation. We demonstrate that combining both forces allows simulating a variety of interesting effects in a plausible way.

 Physically Based Character Skinning  ##   Crispin Deul, Jan Bender In this paper we present a novel multi-layer model for physically-based character skinning. In contrast to geometric approaches which are commonly used in the field of character skinning, physically-based methods can simulate secondary motion effects. Furthermore, these methods can handle collisions and preserve the volume of the model without the need of an additional post-process. Physically-based approaches are computationally more expensive than geometric methods but they provide more realistic results. Recent works in this area use finite element simulations to model the elastic behavior of skin. These methods require the generation of a volumetric mesh for the skin shape in a pre-processing step. It is not easy for an artist to model the different elastic behaviors of muscles, fat and skin using a volumetric mesh since there is no clear assignment between volume elements and tissue types. For our novel multi-layer model the mesh generation is very simple and can be performed automatically. Furthermore, the model contains a layer for each kind of tissue. Therefore, the artist can easily control the elastic behavior by adjusting the stiffness parameters for muscles, fat and skin. We use shape matching with oriented particles and a fast summation technique to simulate the elastic behavior of our skin model and a position-based constraint enforcement to handle collisions, volume conservation and the coupling of the skeleton with the deformable model. Position-based methods have the advantage that they are fast, unconditionally stable, controllable and provide visually plausible results.

 Multilevel Cloth Simulation using GPU Surface Sampling  ##   N. Schmitt, Martin Knuth, Jan Bender, A. Kuijper Today most cloth simulation systems use triangular mesh models. However, regular grids allow many optimizations as connectivity is implicit, warp and weft directions of the cloth are aligned to grid edges and distances between particles are equal. In this paper we introduce a cloth simulation that combines both model types. All operations that are performed on the CPU use a low-resolution triangle mesh while GPU-based methods are performed efficiently on a high-resolution grid representation. Both models are coupled by a sampling operation which renders triangle vertex data into a texture and by a corresponding projection of texel data onto a mesh. The presented scheme is very flexible and allows individual components to be performed on different architectures, data representations and detail levels. The results are combined using shader programs which causes a negligible overhead. We have implemented CPU-based collision handling and a GPU-based hierarchical constraint solver to simulate systems with more than 230k particles in real-time.

 Constrainable Multigrid For Cloth  ##   Inyong Jeon, Kwang-Jin Choi, Tae-Yong Kim, Bong-Ouk Choi, and Hyeong-Seok Ko We present a new technique which can handle both point and sliding constraints in the multigrid (MG) framework. Although the MG method can theoretically perform as fast as O(N), the development of a clothing simulator based on the MG method calls for solving an important technical challenge: handling the constraints. Resolving constrains has been difﬁcult in MG because there has been no clear way to transfer the constraints existing in the ﬁnest level mesh to the coarser level meshes. This paper presents a new formulation based on soft constraints, which can coarsen the constraints deﬁned in the ﬁnest level to the coarser levels. Experiments are performed which show that the proposed method can solve the linear system up to 4–9 times faster in comparison with the modiﬁed preconditioned conjugate gradient method (MPCG) without quality degradation. The proposed method is easy to implement and can be straightforwardly applied to existing clothing simulators which are based on implicit time integration.

 A Semi-Lagrangian Closest Point Method for Deforming Surfaces  ##   Stefan Auer, Rudiger Westermann We present an Eulerian method for the real-time simulation of intrinsic fluid dynamics effects on deforming surfaces. Our method is based on a novel semi-Lagrangian closest point method for the solution of partial differential equations on animated triangle meshes.We describe this method and demonstrate its use to com- pute and visualize flow and wave propagation along such meshes at high resolution and speed. Underlying our technique is the efficient conversion of an animated triangle mesh into a time-dependent implicit repre- sentation based on closest surface points. The proposed technique is unconditionally stable with respect to the surface deformation and, in contrast to comparable Lagrangian techniques, its precision does not depend on the level of detail of the surface triangulation.

 Fracture animation based on high-dimensional Voronoi diagrams  ##   Sara Schvartzmann, Miguel Otaduy We propose a novel algorithm to simulate brittle fracture. It augments previous methods based on Voronoi diagrams, improving their versatility and their ability to adapt fracture patterns automatically to diverse collision scenarios and object properties. We cast brittle fracture as the computation of a high-dimensional Centroidal Voronoi Diagram (CVD), where the distribution of fracture fragments is guided by the deformation field of the fractured object. By formulating the problem in high dimensions, we support robustly object and crack concavities, as well as intuitive artist control. We further accelerate the fracture animation process with example-based learning of the fracture degree, and a highly parallel tessellation algorithm. As a result, we obtain fast animations of detailed and rich fractures, with fracture patterns that adapt to each particular collision scenario.

 IISPH-FLIP for Incompressible Fluids  ##   J. Cornelis, M. Ihmsen, A. Peer, M. Teschner We propose to use Implicit Incompressible Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (IISPH) for pressure projection and boundary handling in Fluid-Implicit-Particle (FLIP) solvers for the simulation of incompressible fluids. This novel combination addresses two issues of existing SPH and FLIP solvers, namely mass preservation in FLIP and efficiency and memory consumption in SPH. First, the SPH component enables the simulation of incompressible fluids with perfect mass preservation. Second, the FLIP component efficiently enriches the SPH component with detail that is comparable to a standard SPH simulation with the same number of particles, while improving the performance by a factor of 7 and significantly reducing the memory consumption. We demonstrate that the proposed IISPH-FLIP solver can simulate incompressible fluids with a quantifiable, imperceptible density deviation below 0:1%. We show large-scale scenarios with up to 160 million particles that have been processed on a single desktop PC using only 15GB of memory. One- and two-way coupled solids are illustrated.

 Robust Simulation of Small-Scale Thin Features in SPH-based Free Surface Flows  ##   Xiaowei He, Huamin Wang, Fengjun Zhang, Hongan Wang, Guoping Wang, Kun Zhou Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is efficient, mass preserving, and flexible in handling topological changes. However, small-scale thin features are difficult to simulate in SPH-based free surface flows, due to a number of robustness and stability issues. In this paper, we address this problem from two perspectives: the robustness of surface forces and the numerical instability of thin features. We present a new surface tension force scheme based on a free surface energy functional, under the diffuse interface model. We develop an efficient way to calculate the air pressure force for free surface flows, without using air particles. Compared with previous surface force formulae, our formulae are more robust against particle sparsity in thin feature cases. To avoid numerical instability on thin features, we propose to adjust the internal pressure force by estimating the internal pressure at two scales and filtering the force using a geometry-aware anisotropic kernel. Our result demonstrates the effectiveness of our algorithms in handling a variety of small-scale thin liquid features, including thin sheets, thin jets, and water splashes.

 Large-Scale Liquid Simulation on Adaptive Hexahedral Grids  ##   Florian Ferstl, Rudiger Westermann, Christian Dick Regular grids are attractive for numerical fluid simulations because they give rise to efficient computational kernels. However, for simulating high resolution effects in complicated domains they are only of limited suitability due to memory constraints. In this paper we present a method for liquid simulation on  an adaptive octree grid using a hexahedral finite element discretization, which reduces memory requirements by coarsening the elements in the interior of the liquid body. To impose free surface boundary conditions with second order accuracy, we incorporate a particular class of Nitsche methods enforcing the Dirichlet boundary conditions for the pressure in a variational sense. We then show how to construct a multigrid hierarchy from the adaptive octree grid, so that a time efficient geometric multigrid solver can be used. To improve solver convergence, we propose a special treatment of liquid boundaries via composite finite elements at coarser scales. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for liquid simulations that would require hundreds of millions of simulation elements in a non-adaptive regime.

 Enhancements to Model-Reduced Fluid Simulation  ##   Dan Gerszewski, Ladislav Kavan, Peter-Pike Sloan, Adam W. Bargteil We present several enhancements to model-reduced fluid simulation that allow improved simulation bases and two-way solid-fluid coupling. Specifically, we present a basis enrichment scheme that allows us to combine data driven or artistically derived bases with more general analytic bases derived from Laplacian Eigenfunctions. We handle two-way solid-fluid coupling in a time-splitting fashion—we alternately timestep the fluid and rigid body simulators, while taking into account the effects of the fluid on the rigid bodies and vice versa. We employ the vortex panel method to handle solid-fluid coupling and use dynamic pressure to compute the effect of the fluid on rigid bodies.

 Deformation Embedding for Point-Based Elastoplastic Simulation  ##   B. Jones, S. Ward, A. Jallepalli, J. Perenia, and A. W. Bargteil We present a straightforward, easy-to-implement, point-based approach for animating elastoplastic materials. The core idea of our approach is the introduction of embedded space, the least-squares best fit of the material’s rest state into three dimensions. Nearest neighbor queries in the embedded space efficiently update particle neighborhoods to account for plastic flow. These queries are simpler and more efficient than remeshing strategies employed in mesh-based finite element methods. We also introduce a new estimate for the volume of a particle, allowing particle masses to vary spatially and temporally with fixed density. Our approach can handle simultaneous extreme elastic and plastic deformations. We demonstrate our approach on a variety of examples that exhibit a wide range of material behaviors.

 SPH Fluids in Computer Graphics  ##   Markus Ihmsen, Jens Orthmann, Barbara Solenthaler, Andreas Kolb, and Matthias Teschner Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) has been established as one of the major concepts for fluid animation in computer graphics.

Nowadays, complex scenes with millions of sampling points, one- and two-way coupled rigid and elastic solids, multiple phases and additional features such as foam or air bubbles can be computed at reasonable expense.

 Efficient Enforcement of Hard Articulation Constraints in the Presence of Closed Loops and Contacts  ##   Robin Tomcin, Dominik Sibbing, Leif Kobbelt In rigid body simulation, one must distinguish between contacts (so-called unilateral constraints) and articulations (bilateral constraints). For contacts and friction, iterative solution methods have proven most useful for interactive applications, often in combination with Shock-Propagation in cases with strong interactions between contacts (such as stacks), prioritizing performance and plausibility over accuracy. For articulation constraints, direct solution methods are preferred, because one can rely on a factorization with linear time complexity for tree-like systems, even in ill-conditioned cases caused by large mass-ratios or high complexity. Despite recent advances, combining the advantages of direct and iterative solution methods wrt. performance has proven difficult and the intricacy of articulations in interactive applications is often limited by the convergence speed of the iterative solution method in the presence of closed kinematic loops (i.e. auxiliary constraints) and contacts. We identify common performance bottlenecks in the dynamic simulation of unilateral and bilateral constraints and are able to present a simulation method, that scales well in the number of constraints even in ill-conditioned cases with frictional contacts, collisions and closed loops in the kinematic graph. For cases where many joints are connected to a single body, we propose a technique to increase the sparsity of the positive definite linear system. A solution to these bottlenecks is presented in this paper to make the simulation of a wider range of mechanisms possible in real-time without extensive parameter tuning.

 Implicit Multibody Penalty-based Distributed Contact  ##   Hongyi Xu, Yili Zhao, and Jernej Barbic The penalty method is a simple and popular approach to resolving contact in computer graphics and robotics. Penalty-based contact, however, suffers from stability problems due to the highly variable and unpredictable net stiffness, and this is particularly pronounced in simulations with time-varying distributed geometrically complex contact. We employ semi-implicit integration, exact analytical contact gradients, symbolic Gaussian elimination and a SVD solver to simulate stable penalty-based frictional contact with large, time-varying contact areas, involving many rigid objects and articulated rigid objects in complex conforming contact and self-contact. We also derive implicit proportional-derivative control forces for real-time control of articulated structures with loops. We present challenging contact scenarios such as screwing a hexbolt into a hole, bowls stacked in perfectly conforming configurations, and manipulating many objects using actively controlled articulated mechanisms in real time.

 Animating Deformable Objects using Sparse Spacetime Constraints  ##   Christian Schulz, Christoph von Tycowicz, Hans-Peter Seidel, Klaus Hildebrandt We propose a scheme for animating deformable objects based on spacetime optimization. The main feature is that it robustly and quickly (within a few seconds) generates interesting motion from a sparse set of spacetime constraints. Providing only partial (as opposed to full) keyframes for positions and velocities is sufficient. The computed motion satisfies the constraints and the remaining degrees of freedom are determined by physical principles using elasticity and the spacetime constraints paradigm. Our modeling of the spacetime optimization problem combines dimensional reduction, modal coordinates, wiggly splines, and rotation strain warping. Controlling the warped motion requires the derivative of the warp map. We derive a representation of the derivative that can be efficiently and robustly evaluated. Our solver is based on a theorem that characterizes the solutions of the optimization problem and allows us to restrict the optimization to very low-dimensional search spaces. This treatment of the optimization problem avoids a time discretization and the resulting method can robustly deal with sparse input and wiggly motion.

 Detailed Water with Coarse Grids: Combining Surface Meshes and  Adaptive Discontinuous Galerkin  ##   Essex Edwards, Robert Bridson We present a new adaptive fluid simulation method that captures a high resolution surface with precise dynamics, without an inefficient fine discretization of the entire fluid volume. Prior adap- tive methods using octrees or unstructured meshes carry large over- heads and implementation complexity. We instead stick with coarse regular Cartesian grids, using detailed cut cells at boundaries, and discretize the dynamics with a p-adaptive Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method. This retains much of the data structure simplicity of regular grids, more efficiently captures smooth parts of the flow, and offers the flexibility to easily increase resolving power where needed without geometric refinement.

 Simulating Articulated Subspace Self-Contact  ##   Yun Teng, Miguel Otaduy, Theodore Kim We present an efficient new subspace method for simulating the self-contact of articulated deformable bodies, such as characters. Self-contact is highly structured in this setting, as the limited space of possible articulations produces a predictable set of coherent collisions. Subspace methods can leverage this coherence, and have been used in the past to accelerate the collision detection stage of contact simulation. We show that these methods can be used to accelerate the entire contact computation, and allow self-contact to be resolved without looking at all of the contact points. Our analysis of the problem yields a broader insight into the types of nonlinearities that subspace methods can efficiently approximate, and leads us to design a pose-space cubature scheme. Our algorithm accelerates self-contact by up to an order of magnitude over other subspace simulations, and accelerates the overall simulation by two orders of magnitude over full-rank simulations. We demonstrate the simulation of high resolution (100K – 400K elements) meshes in self-contact at interactive rates (5.8 – 50 FPS).

 Codimensional Surface Tension Flow on Simplicial Complexes  ##   Bo Zhu, Ed Quigley, Matthew Cong, Justin Solomon, and Ron Fedkiw Many visually interesting natural phenomena are characterized by thin liquid sheets, long filaments, and droplets. We present a new Lagrangian-based numerical method to simulate these codimensional surface tension driven phenomena using non-manifold simplicial complexes. Tetrahedra, triangles, segments, and points are used to model the fluid volume, thin films, filaments, and droplets, respectively. We present a new method for enforcing fluid incompressibility on simplicial complexes along with a physically-guided meshing algorithm to provide temporally consistent information for interparticle forces. Our method naturally allows for transitions between codimensions, either from tetrahedra to triangles to segments to points or vice versa, regardless of the simulation resolution. We demonstrate the efficacy of this method by simulating various natural phenomena that are characterized by thin fluid sheets, filaments, and surface tension effects.

 Adaptive Tearing and Cracking of Thin Sheets  ##   Tobias Pfaff, Rahul Narain, Juan Miguel de Joya, and James F. O’Brien This paper presents a method for adaptive fracture propagation in thin sheets. A high-quality triangle mesh is dynamically restructured to adaptively maintain detail wherever it is required by the simulation. These requirements include refining where cracks are likely to either start or advance. Refinement ensures that the stress distribution around the crack tip is well resolved, which is vital for creating highly detailed, realistic crack paths. The dynamic meshing framework allows subsequent coarsening once areas are no longer likely to produce cracking. This coarsening allows efficient simulation by reducing the total number of active nodes and by preventing the formation of thin slivers around the crack path. A local reprojection scheme and a substepping fracture process help to ensure stability and prevent a loss of plasticity during remeshing. By including bending and stretching plasticity models, the method is able to simulate a large range of materials with very different fracture behaviors.

We introduce a semi-automatic method for matching two existing liquid animations, which we use to create new fluid motion that plausibly interpolates the input. Our contributions include a new space-time non-rigid iterative closest point algorithm that incorporates user guidance, a subsampling technique for efficient registration of meshes with millions of vertices, and a fast surface extraction algorithm that produces 3D triangle meshes from a 4D space-time surface. Our technique can be used to instantly create hundreds of new simulations, or to interactively explore complex parameter spaces. Our method is guaranteed to produce output that does not deviate from the input animations, and it generalizes to multiple dimensions. Because our method runs at interactive rates after the initial precomputation step, it has potential applications in games and training simulations.

 Multimaterial Mesh-Based Surface Tracking  ##   Fang Da, Christopher Batty, Eitan Grinspun We present a triangle mesh-based technique for tracking the evolution of three-dimensional multimaterial interfaces undergoing complex deformations. It is the first non-manifold triangle mesh tracking method to simultaneously maintain intersection-free meshes and support the proposed broad set of multimaterial remeshing and topological operations. We represent the interface as a non-manifold triangle mesh with material labels assigned to each half-face to distinguish volumetric regions. Starting from proposed application-dependent vertex velocities, we deform the mesh, seeking a non-intersecting, watertight solution. This goal necessitates development of various collision-safe, label-aware non-manifold mesh operations: multimaterial mesh improvement; T1 and T2 processes, topological transitions arising in foam dynamics and multi-phase flows; and multimaterial merging, in which a new interface is created between colliding materials. We demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our approach on a range of scenarios including geometric flows and multiphase fluid animation.

 Space-Time Editing of Elastic Motions through Material Optimization and Reduction  ##   Siwang Li, Jin Huang, Fernando de Goes, Xiaogang Jin, Hujun Bao, and Mathieu Desbrun We present a novel method for elastic animation editing with spacetime constraints. In a sharp departure from previous approaches, we not only optimize control forces added to a linearized dynamic model, but also optimize material properties to better match user constraints and provide plausible and consistent motion. Our approach achieves efficiency and scalability by performing all computations in a reduced rotation-strain (RS) space constructed with both cubature and geometric reduction, leading to two orders of magnitude improvement over the original RS method. We demonstrate the utility and versatility of our method in various applications, including motion editing, pose interpolation, and estimation of material parameters from existing animation sequences.

 Inverse-Foley Animation: Synchronizing rigid-body motions to sound  ##   Timothy R. Langlois and Doug L. James In this paper, we introduce Inverse-Foley Animation, a technique for optimizing rigid-body animations so that contact events are synchronized with input sound events. A precomputed database of randomly sampled rigid-body contact events is used to build a contact-event graph, which can be searched to determine a plausible sequence of contact events synchronized with the input sound’s events. To more easily find motions with matching contact times, we allow transitions between simulated contact events using a motion blending formulation based on modified contact impulses. We fine tune synchronization by slightly retiming ballistic motions. Given a sound, our system can synthesize synchronized motions using graphs built with hundreds of thousands of precomputed motions, and millions of contact events. Our system is easy to use, and has been used to plan motions for hundreds of sounds, and dozens of rigid-body models.

 Robust Hair Capture Using Simulated Examples  ##   Liwen Hu, Chongyang Ma, Linjie Luo, and Hao Li We introduce a data-driven hair capture framework based on example strands generated through hair simulation. Our method can robustly reconstruct faithful 3D hair models from unprocessed input point clouds with large amounts of outliers. Current state-of-the-art techniques use geometrically-inspired heuristics to derive global hair strand structures, which can yield implausible hair strands for hairstyles involving large occlusions, multiple layers, or wisps of varying lengths. We address this problem using a voting-based fitting algorithm to discover structurally plausible configurations among the locally grown hair segments from a database of simulated examples. To generate these examples, we exhaustively sample the simulation configurations within the feasible parameter space constrained by the current input hairstyle. The number of necessary simulations can be further reduced by leveraging symmetry and constrained initial conditions. The final hairstyle can then be structurally represented by a limited number of examples. To handle constrained hairstyles such as a ponytail of which realistic simulations are more difficult, we allow the user to sketch a few strokes to generate strand examples through an intuitive interface. Our approach focuses on robustness and generality. Since our method is structurally plausible by construction, we ensure an improved control during hair digitization and avoid implausible hair synthesis for a wide range of hairstyles.

Using particles connected by constraints as our fundamental building block allows us to treat contact and collisions in a unified manner, and we show how this representation is flexible enough to model gases, liquids, deformable solids, rigid bodies and clothing with two-way interactions. We address some common problems with traditional particle based methods and describe a parallel constraint solver based on position based dynamics that is efficient enough for real-time applications.

 A Reduced Model for Interactive Hairs  ##   Menglei Chai, Changxi Zheng, Kun Zhou Realistic hair animation is a crucial component in depicting virtual characters in interactive applications. While much progress has been made in high-quality hair simulation, the overwhelming computation cost hinders similar fidelity in realtime simulations. To bridge this gap, we propose a data-driven solution. Building upon precomputed simulation data, our approach constructs a reduced model to optimally represent hair motion characteristics with a small number of guide hairs and the corresponding interpolation relationships. At runtime, utilizing such a reduced model, we only simulate guide hairs that capture the general hair motion and interpolate all rest strands. We further propose a hair correction method that corrects the resulting hair motion with a position-based model to resolve hair collisions and thus captures motion details. Our hair simulation method enables a simulation of a full head of hairs with over 150K strands in realtime. We demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of our method with various hairstyles and driven motions (e.g., head movement and wind force), and compared against full simulation results that does not appear in the training data.

 Strain-Based Dynamics  ##   Matthias Mueller, Nuttapong Chentanez, Tae-Yong Kim, Miles Macklin We propose a new set of constraints within the Position Based Dynamics (PBD) framework that allow the control of strain in directions that are independent of the edge directions of the simulation mesh. Instead of constraining distances between points, we constrain the entries of the Green – St Venant strain tensor. Varying the stiffness values corresponding to the individual strain coefﬁcients lets us simulate anisotropic behavior. By working with Green’s rotation-independent, non-linear strain tensor directly we do not have to perform a polar decomposition of the deformation gradient as in most strain limiting approaches. In addition, we propose a modiﬁcation of the constraints corresponding to the diagonal entries of the strain tensor such that they can be solved in a single step and a modiﬁcation of the constraints corresponding to the off-diagonal entries to decouple stretch from shear resistance. By formulating the constraints within the PBD framework, they can be used not only for strain limiting but to perform the actual simulation of the deformable object whereas traditional strain limiting methods have to be paired with a separate simulation method.

 Multiple-Fluid SPH Simulation Using a Mixture Model  ##   Bo Reng, Chenfeng Li, Xiao Yan, Ming C. Lin, Javier Bonet, Shi-Min Hu This paper presents a versatile and robust SPH simulation approach for multiple-fluid flows. The spatial distribution of different phases or components is modeled using the volume fraction representation, the dynamics of multiple-fluid flows is captured by using an improved mixture model, and a stable and accurate SPH formulation is rigorously derived to resolve the complex transport and transformation processes encountered in multiple-fluid flows. The new approach can capture a wide range of realworld multiple-fluid phenomena, including mixing/unmixing of miscible and immiscible fluids, diffusion effect and chemical reaction etc. Moreover, the new multiple-fluid SPH scheme can be readily integrated into existing state-of-the-art SPH simulators, and the multiple-fluid simulation is easy to set up. Various examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

 From Capture to Simulation – Connecting Forward and Inverse Problems in Fluids  ##   James Gregson, Ivo Irkhe, Nils Thuerey, Wolfgang Heidrich We explore the connection between fluid capture, simulation and proximal methods, a class of algorithms commonly used for inverse problems in image processing and computer vision. Our key finding is that the proximal operator constraining fluid velocities to be divergence-free is directly equivalent to the pressure-projection methods commonly used in incompressible flow solvers. This observation lets us treat the inverse problem of fluid tracking as a constrained flow problem all while working in an efficient, modular framework. In addition it lets us tightly couple fluid simulation into flow tracking, providing a global prior that significantly increases tracking accuracy and temporal coherence as compared to previous techniques. We demonstrate how we can use these improved results for a variety of applications, such as re-simulation, detail enhancement, and domain modification. We furthermore give an outlook of the applications beyond fluid tracking that our proximal operator framework could enable by exploring the connection of deblurring and fluid guiding.

 View-Dependent Adaptive Cloth Simulation  ##   Woojong Koh, Rahul Narain, James F. O’Brien This paper describes a method for view-dependent cloth simulation using dynamically adaptive mesh refinement and coarsening. Given a prescribed camera motion, the method adjusts the criteria controlling refinement to account for visibility and apparent size in the camera’s view. Objectionable dynamic artifacts are avoided by anticipative refinement and smoothed coarsening. This approach preserves the appearance of detailed cloth throughout the animation while avoiding the wasted effort of simulating details that would not be discernible to the viewer. The computational savings realized by this method increase as scene complexity grows, producing a 2x speed-up for a single character and more than 4x for a small group.

 Ocean Waves Animation using Boundary Integral Equations and Explicit Mesh Tracking  ##   Todd Keeler, Robert Bridson We tackle deep water simulation in a scalable way, solving 3D irrotational flow using only variables stored in a mesh of the surface of the water, in time proportional to the rendered mesh. The heart of our method is a novel boundary integral equation formulation that is amenable to explicit mesh tracking with unstructured triangle meshes. Our method complements FFT style waves as it is able to handle solid boundaries. It is less memory intensive than volumetric methods and inherently handles the near-infinite depth of the deep ocean. We demonstrate acceleration techniques using the FMM and GPU computing. The natural Lagrangian motion of our model gives inherent adaptivity to our simulation without the need for direct mesh operations.

 Adaptive Tetrahedral Meshes for Brittle Fracture Simulation  ##   Dan Koschier, Sebastian Lipponer, Jan Bender We present a method for the adaptive simulation of brittle fracture of solid objects based on a novel reversible tetrahedral mesh refinement scheme. The refinement scheme preserves the quality of the input mesh to a large extent, it is solely based on topological operations, and does not alter the boundary, i.e. any geometric feature. Our fracture algorithm successively performs a stress analysis and increases the resolution of the input mesh in regions of high tensile stress. This results in an accurate location of crack origins without the need of a general high resolution mesh which would cause high computational costs throughout the whole simulation. A crack is initiated when the maximum tensile stress exceeds the material strength. The introduced algorithm then proceeds by iteratively recomputing the changed stress state and creating further cracks. Our approach can generate multiple cracks from a single impact but effectively avoids shattering artifacts. Once the tensile stress decreases, the mesh refinement is reversed to increase the performance of the simulation. We demonstrate that our adaptive method is robust, scalable and computes highly realistic fracture results.

 Stable Orthotropic Materials  ##   Yijing Li, Jernej Barbič Isotropic Finite Element Method (FEM) deformable object simulations are widely used in computer graphics. Several applications (wood, plants, muscles) require modeling the directional dependence of the material elastic properties in three orthogonal directions. We investigate orthotropic materials, a special class of anisotropic materials where the shear stresses are decoupled from normal stresses. Orthotropic materials generalize transversely isotropic materials, by exhibiting different stiffnesses in three orthogonal directions. Orthotropic materials are, however, parameterized by nine values that are difficult to tune in practice, as poorly adjusted settings easily lead to simulation instabilities. We present a user-friendly approach to setting these parameters that is guaranteed to be stable. Our approach is intuitive as it extends the familiar intuition known from isotropic materials. We demonstrate our technique by augmenting linear corotational FEM implementations with orthotropic materials.

 Position-Based Elastic Rods  ##   Nobuyuki Umetani, Ryan Schmidt, Jos Stam We present a novel method to simulate complex bending and twisting of elastic rods. Elastic rods are commonly simulated using force based methods, such as the finite element method. These methods are accurate, but do not directly fit into the more efficient position-based dynamics framework, since the definition of material frames are not entirely based on positions. We introduce ghost points, which are additional points defined on edges, to naturally endow continuous material frames on discretized rods. We achieve robustness by a novel discretization of the Cosserat theory. The method supports coupling with a frame, a triangle, and a rigid body at the rod’s end point. Our formulation is highly efficient, capable of simulating hundreds of strands in real-time.

 Functional Fluids on Surfaces  ##   Omri Azencot, Steffen Weißmann, Maks Ovsjanikov, Max Wardetzky, Mirela Ben-Chen Fluid simulation plays a key role in various domains of science including computer graphics. While most existing work addresses fluids on bounded Euclidean domains, we consider the problem of simulating the behavior of an incompressible fluid on a curved surface represented as an unstructured triangle mesh. Unlike the commonly used Eulerian description of the fluid using its time-varying velocity field, we propose to model fluids using their vorticity, i.e., by a (time varying) scalar function on the surface. During each time step, we advance scalar vorticity along two consecutive, stationary velocity fields. This approach leads to a variational integrator in the space continuous setting. In addition, using this approach, the update rule amounts to manipulating functions on the surface using linear operators, which can be discretized efficiently using the recently introduced functional approach to vector fields. Combining these time and space discretizations leads to a conceptually and algorithmically simple approach, which is efficient, time-reversible and conserves vorticity by construction. We further demonstrate that our method exhibits no numerical dissipation and is able to reproduce intricate phenomena such as vortex shedding from boundaries.

 Adaptive Nonlinearity for Collisions in Complex Rod Assemblies  ##   Danny M. Kaufman, Rasmus Tamstorf, Breannan Smith, Jean-Marie Aubry, Eitan Grinspun We develop an algorithm for the efficient and stable simulation of large-scale elastic rod assemblies. We observe that the time-integration step is severely restricted by a strong nonlinearity in the response of stretching modes to transversal impact, the degree of this nonlinearity varying greatly with the shape of the rod. Building on these observations, we propose the ADONIS collision response algorithm that adapts the degree of nonlinearity in impact solves. We illustrate the advantages of the ADONIS algorithm by analyzing simulations involving elastic rod assemblies of varying density and scale, with up to 1.7 million individual contacts per time step.

 Interactive Rendering of Giga-Particle Fluid Simulations  ##   Florian Reichl,  Matthäus G. Chajdas,  Jens Schneider, and  Rüdiger Westermann We describe the design of an interactive rendering system for particle-based fluid simulations comprising hundreds of millions of particles per time step. We present a novel binary voxel representation for particle positions in combination with random jitter to drastically reduce memory and bandwidth requirements. To avoid a time-consuming preprocess and restrict the workload to what is seen, the construction of this representation is embedded into front-to-back GPU ray-casting. For high speed rendering, we ray-cast spheres and extend on total-variation-based image de-noising models to smooth the fluid surface according to data specific boundary conditions. The regular voxel structure permits highly efficient ray-sphere intersection testing as well as classification of foam particles at runtime on the GPU. Foam particles are rendered volumetrically by reconstructing densities from the binary representation on-the-fly. The particular design of our system allows scrubbing through high-resolution animated fluids at interactive rates.

Our physiologically based muscle activation model utilizes knowledge of the active shapes of muscles, which can be easily obtained from medical imaging data or designed to meet artistic needs.

 Defending Continuous Collision Detection against Errors  ##   Huamin Wang Numerical errors and rounding errors in continuous collision detection (CCD) can easily cause collision detection failures if they are not handled properly. A simple and effective approach is to use error tolerances, as shown in many existing CCD systems. Unfortunately, finding the optimal tolerance values is a difficult problem for users. Larger tolerance values will introduce false positive artifacts, while smaller tolerance values may cause collisions to be undetected. The biggest issue here is that we do not know whether or when CCD will fail, even though failures are extremely rare. In this paper, we demonstrate a set of simple modifications to make a basic CCD implementation failure-proof. Using error analysis, we prove the safety of this method and we formulate suggested tolerance values to reduce false positives. The resulting algorithms are safe, automatic, efficient, and easy to implement.

 Physics-Inspired Adaptive Fracture Refinement  ##   Zhili Chen, Miaojun Yao, Renguo Feng, Huamin Wang Physically based animation of detailed fracture effects is not only computationally expensive, but also difficult to implement due to numerical instability. In this paper, we propose a physics-inspired approach to enrich low-resolution fracture animation by realistic fracture details. Given a custom-designed material strength field, we adaptively refine a coarse fracture surface into a detailed one, based on a discrete gradient descent flow. Using the new fracture surface, we then generate a high-resolution fracture animation with details on both the fracture surface and the exterior surface. Our experiment shows that this approach is simple, fast, and friendly to user design and control. It can generate realistic fracture animations within a few seconds.

 Efficient Denting and Bending of Rigid Bodies  ##   Saket Patkar, Mridul Aanjaneya, Aric Bartle, Minjae Lee, Ronald Fedkiw We present a novel method for the efficient denting and bending of rigid bodies without the need for expensive finite element simulations. Denting is achieved by deforming the triangulated surface of the target body based on a dent map computed on-the-fly from the projectile body using a Z-buffer algorithm with varying degrees of smoothing. Our method accounts for the angle of impact, is applicable to arbitrary shapes, readily scales to thousands of rigid bodies, is amenable to artist control, and also works well in combination with prescoring algorithms for fracture. Bending is addressed by augmenting a rigid body with an articulated skeleton which is used to drive skinning weights for the bending deformation. The articulated skeleton is simulated to include the effects of both elasticity and plasticity. Furthermore, we allow joints to be added dynamically so that bending can occur in a nonpredetermined way and/or as dictated by the artist. Conversely, we present an articulation condensation method that greatly simplifies large unneeded branches and chains on-the-fly for increased efficiency.

 A Peridynamic Perspective on Spring-Mass Fracture  ##   Joshua A. Levine, Adam W. Bargteil, Christopher Corsi, Jerry Tessendorf, Robert Geist  The application of spring-mass systems to the animation of brittle fracture is revisited. The motivation arises from the recent popularity of peridynamics in the computational physics community. Peridynamic systems can be regarded as spring-mass systems with two specific properties. First, spring forces are based on a simple strain metric, thereby decoupling spring stiffness from spring length. Second, masses are connected using a distance-based criterion. The relatively large radius of influence typically leads to a few hundred springs for every mass point. Spring-mass systems with these properties are shown to be simple to implement, trivially parallelized, and well-suited to animating brittle fracture.

 Sensitivity-optimized Rigging for Example-based Real-Time Clothing Synthesis  ##   Weiwei Xu, Noboyuki Umetani, Qianwen Chao, Jie Mao, Xiaogang Jin, Xin Tong We present a real-time solution for generating detailed clothing deformations from pre-computed clothing shape examples. Given an input pose, it synthesizes a clothing deformation by blending skinned clothing deformations of nearby examples controlled by the body skeleton. Observing that cloth deformation can be well modeled with sensitivity analysis driven by the underlying skeleton, we introduce a sensitivity based method to construct a pose-dependent rigging solution from sparse examples. We also develop a sensitivity based blending scheme to find nearby examples for the input pose and evaluate their contributions to the result. Finally, we propose a stochastic optimization based greedy scheme for sampling the pose space and generating example clothing shapes.

 Optimization Integrator for Large Time Steps  ##   Theodore F. Gast, Craig Schroeder Practical time steps in today’s state-of-the-art simulators typically rely on Newton’s method to solve large systems of nonlinear equations. In practice, this works well for small time steps but is unreliable at large time steps at or near the frame rate, particularly for difficult or stiff simulations. We show that recasting backward Euler as a minimization problem allows Newton’s method to be stabilized by standard optimization techniques with some novel improvements of our own. The resulting solver is capable of solving even the toughest simulations at the 24Hz frame rate and beyond. We show how simple collisions can be incorporated directly into the solver through constrained minimization without sacrificing efficiency. We also present novel penalty collision formulations for self collisions and collisions against scripted bodies designed for the unique demands of this solver.

 Augmented MPM for phase-change and varied materials  ##   Alexey Stomakhin, Craig Schroeder, Chenfanfu Jiang, Lawrence Chai, Joseph Teran, Andrew Selle In this paper, we introduce a novel material point method for heat transport, melting and solidifying materials. This brings a wider range of material behaviors into reach of the already versatile material point method. This is in contrast to best-of-breed fluid, solid or rigid body solvers that are difficult to adapt to a wide range of materials. Extending the material point method requires several contributions. We introduce a dilational/deviatoric splitting of the constitutive model and show that an implicit treatment of the Eulerian evolution of the dilational part can be used to simulate arbitrarily incompressible materials. Furthermore, we show that this treatment reduces to a parabolic equation for moderate compressibility and an elliptic, Chorin-style projection at the incompressible limit. Since projections are naturally done on marker and cell (MAC) grids, we devise a staggered grid MPM method. Lastly, to generate varying material parameters, we adapt a heat-equation solver to a material point framework.

 An Adaptive Virtual Node Algorithm with Robust Mesh Cutting  ##   Yuting Wang, Chenfanfu Jiang, Craig Schroeder, Joseph Teran We present a novel virtual node algorithm (VNA) for changing tetrahedron mesh topology to represent arbitrary cutting triangulated surfaces. Our approach addresses a number of shortcomings in the original VNA of [MBF04]. First, we generalize the VNA so that cuts can pass through tetrahedron mesh vertices and lie on mesh edges and faces. The original algorithm did not make sense for these cases and required often ambiguous perturbation of the cutting surface to avoid them. Second, we develop an adaptive approach to the definition of embedded material used for element duplication. The original algorithm could only handle a limited number of configurations which restricted cut surfaces to have curvature at the scale of the tetrahedron elements. Our adaptive approach allows for cut surfaces with curvatures independent of the embedding tetrahedron mesh resolution. Finally, we present a novel, provably-robust floating point mesh intersection routine that accurately registers triangulated surface cuts against the background tetrahedron mesh without the need for exact arithmetic.

 Coupling 3D Eulerian, Height Field and Particle Methods for the Simulation of Large Scale Liquid Phenomena  ##   Nuttapong Chentanez, Matthias Mueller, Tae-Yong Kim We propose a new method to simulate large scale water phenomena by combining particle, 3D grid and height field methods. In contrast to most hybrid approaches that use particles to simulate foam and spray only, we also represent the bulk of water near the surface with both particles and a grid depending on the regions of interest and switch between those two representations during the course of the simulation. For the coupling we leverage the recent idea of tracking the water surface with a density field in grid based methods. Combining particles and a grid simulation then amounts to adding the density field of the particles and the one stored on the grid. For open scenes, we simulate the water outside of the 3D grid domain by solving the Shallow Water Equations on a height field. We propose new methods to couple these two domains such that waves travel naturally across the border. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in various scenarios including a whale breaching simulation, all running in real-time or at interactive rates.

 Subspace Clothing Simulation Using Adaptive Bases  ##   Fabian Hahn, Bernhard Thomaszewski, Stelian Coros, Robert W. Sumner, Forrester Cole, Mark Meyer, Tony DeRose, and Markus Gross We present a new approach to clothing simulation using low-dimensional linear subspaces with temporally adaptive bases. Our method exploits full-space simulation training data in order to construct a pool of low-dimensional bases distributed across pose space. For this purpose, we interpret the simulation data as offsets from a kinematic deformation model that captures the global shape of clothing due to body pose. During subspace simulation, we select low-dimensional sets of basis vectors according to the current pose of the character and the state of its clothing. Thanks to this adaptive basis selection scheme, our method is able to reproduce diverse and detailed folding patterns with only a few basis vectors. Our experiments demonstrate the feasibility of subspace clothing simulation and indicate its potential in terms of quality and computational efficiency.

We present a geometrically exact CCD algorithm based on the exact geometric computation paradigm to perform reliable Boolean collision queries. This algorithm is more than an order of magnitude faster than prior exact algorithms. We evaluate its performance for cloth and FEM simulations on CPUs and GPUs, and highlight the benefits.

 Continuous Collision Detection Between Points and  Signed Distance Fields  ##   Hongyi Xu, Jernej Barbic We present an algorithm for fast continuous collision detection between points and signed distance fields. Such robust queries are often needed in computer animation, haptics and virtual reality applications, but have so far only been investigated for polygon (triangular) geometry representations. We demonstrate how to use an octree subdivision of the distance field for fast traversal of distance field cells. We also give a method to combine octree subdivision with points organized into a tree hierarchy, for efficient culling of continuous collision detection tests. We apply our method to multibody rigid simulations, and demonstrate that our method accelerates continuous collision detection between points and distance fields by an order of magnitude.

 Animation of Deformable Bodies with Quadratic Bézier Finite Elements  ##   Adam W. Bargteil, Elaine Cohen In this paper, we investigate the use of quadratic finite elements for graphical animation of deformable bodies. We consider both integrating quadratic elements with conventional linear elements to achieve a computationally efficient adaptive-degree simulation framework as well as wholly quadratic elements for the simulation of non-linear rest shapes. In both cases, we adopt the Bézier basis functions and employ a co-rotational linear strain formulation. As with linear elements, the co-rotational formulation allows us to precompute per-element stiffness matrices, resulting in substantial computational savings. We present several examples that demonstrate the advantages of quadratic elements in general and our adaptive-degree system in particular. Furthermore, we demonstrate, for the first time in computer graphics, animations of volumetric deformable bodies with non-linear rest shapes.

 Particle-particle Particle-mesh (PPPM) Fast Summation for Fluids and Beyond  ##   Xinxin Zhang, Robert Bridson Solving the N-body problem, i.e. the Poisson problem with point sources, is a common task in graphics and simulation. The naive direct summation of the kernel function over all particles scales quadratically, rendering it too slow for large problems, while the optimal Fast Multipole Method has drastic implementation complexity and can sometimes carry too high an overhead to be practical. We present a new Particle-Particle Particle-Mesh (PPPM) algorithm which is fast, accurate, and easy to implement even in parallel on a GPU. We capture long-range interactions with a fast multigrid solver on a background grid with a novel boundary condition, while short-range interactions are calculated directly with a new error compensation to avoid error from the background grid. We demonstrate the power of PPPM with a new vortex particle smoke solver, which features a vortex segment-approach to the stretching term, potential flow to enforce no-stick solid boundaries on arbitrary moving solid boundaries, and a new mechanism for vortex shedding from boundary layers. Comparison against a simpler Vortex-in-Cell approach shows PPPM can produce significantly more detailed results with less computation. In addition, we use our PPPM solver for a Poisson surface reconstruction problem to show its potential as a general-purpose Poisson solver.

 Stylized Keyframe Animation of Fluid Simulations  ##   Mark Browning, Connelly Barnes, Samantha Ritter, Adam Finkelstein We present a method that combines hand-drawn artwork with fluid simulations to produce animated fluids in the visual style of the artwork. Given a fluid simulation and a set of keyframes rendered by the artist in any medium, our system produces a set of in-betweens that visually matches the style of the keyframes and roughly follows the motion from the underlying simulation. Our method leverages recent advances in patch-based regenerative morphing and image melding to produce temporally coherent sequences with visual fidelity to the target medium. Because direct application of these methods results in motion that is generally not fluid-like, we adapt them to produce motion closely matching that of the underlying simulation. The resulting animation is visually and temporally coherent, stylistically consistent with the given keyframes, and approximately matches the motion from the simulation. We demonstrate the method with animations in a variety of visual styles.

 Parallel Particles (P^2): A Parallel Position Based Approach for Fast and Stable Simulation of Granular Materials  ##   Daniel Holz Granular materials exhibit a large number of diverse physical phenomena which makes their numerical simulation challenging. When set in motion they flow almost like a fluid, while they can present high shear strength when at rest. Those macroscopic effects result from the material’s microstructure: a particle skeleton with interlocking particles which stick to and slide across each other, producing soil cohesion and friction. For the purpose of Earthmoving equipment operator training, we developed Parallel Particles (P2), a fast and stable position based granular material simulator which models inter-particle friction and adhesion and captures the physical nature of soil to an extend sufficient for training. Our parallel solver makes the approach scalable and applicable to modern multi-core architectures yielding the simulation speed required in this application. Using a regularization procedure, we successfully model visco-elastic particle interactions on the position level which provides real, physical parameters allowing for intuitive tuning. We employ the proposed technique in an Excavator training simulator and demonstrate that it yields physically plausible results at interactive to real-time simulation rates.

 Coupling Hair with Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics Fluids  ##   Wei-Chin Lin We present a two-way coupling technique for simulating the complex interaction between hair and fluids. In our approach, the motion of hair and fluids is simulated by evaluating the hydrodynamic forces among them based on boundary handling techniques used in SPH (Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics) fluids. When hair makes contact with fluids, water absorption inside the hair volume can be simulated with a diffusion process by treating the hair volume as porous media with anisotropic permeability. The saturation of each hair strand is then used to derive the adhesive force between wet hair strands. This enables us to simulate the formation of hair clumps dynamically without the need to employ post clumping processes. The proposed method can be easily applied to any SPH fluid solvers as well as various hair models.

 SPGrid: A Sparse Paged Grid structure applied to adaptive smoke simulation  ##   Rajsekhar Setaluri, Mridul Aanjaneya, Sean Bauer, and Eftychios Sifakis We introduce a new method for fluid simulation on high-resolution adaptive grids which rivals the throughput and parallelism potential of methods based on uniform grids. Our enabling contribution is SPGrid, a new data structure for compact storage and efficient stream processing of sparsely populated uniform Cartesian grids.SPGrid leverages the extensive hardware acceleration mechanisms inherent in the x86 Virtual Memory Management system to deliver sequential and stencil access bandwidth comparable to dense uniform grids. Second, we eschew tree-based adaptive data structures in favor of storing simulation variables in a pyramid of sparsely populated uniform grids, thus avoiding the cost of indirect memory access associated with pointer-based representations. We show how the costliest algorithmic kernels of fluid simulation can be implemented as a composition of two kernel types: (a) stencil operations on a single sparse uniform grid, and (b) structured data transfers between adjacent levels of resolution, even when modeling non-graded octrees. Finally, we demonstrate an adaptive multigridpreconditioned Conjugate Gradient solver that achieves resolutionindependent convergence rates while admitting a lightweight implementation with a modest memory footprint. Our method is complemented by a new interpolation scheme that reduces dissipative effects and simplifies dynamic grid adaptation. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method in end-to-end simulations of smoke flow.

 Windy Trees: Computing Stress Response for Developmental Tree Models  ##   Sören Pirk, Till Niese, Torsten Hädrich, Bedrich Benes, Oliver Deussen We present a novel method for combining developmental tree models with turbulent wind fields. The tree geometry is created from internal growth functions of the developmental model and its response to external stress is induced by a physically-plausible wind field that is simulated by Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). Our tree models are dynamically evolving complex systems that (1) react in real-time to high-frequent changes of the wind simulation; and (2) adapt to long-term wind stress. We extend this process by wind-related effects such as branch breaking as well as bud abrasion and drying. In our interactive system the user can adjust the parameters of the growth model, modify wind properties and resulting forces, and define the tree’s long-term response to wind. By using graphics hardware, our implementation runs at interactive rates for moderately large scenes composed of up to 20 tree models.

 Multi-layer skin simulation with adaptive constraints  ##   Pengbo Li, Paul Kry We present an approach for physics based simulation of the wrinkling of multi-layer skin with heterogeneous material properties. Each layer of skin is simulated with an adaptive mesh, with the different layers coupled via constraints that only permit wrinkle deformation at wavelengths that match the physical properties of the multi-layer model. We use texture maps to define varying elasticity and thickness of the skin layers, and design our constraints as continuous functions, which we discretize at run time to match the changing adaptive mesh topology. In our examples, we use blend shapes to drive the bottom layer, and we present a variety of examples of simulations that demonstrate small wrinkles on top of larger wrinkles, which is a typical pattern seen on human skin. Finally, we show that our physics-based wrinkles can be used in the automatic creation of wrinkle maps, allowing the visual details of our high resolution simulations to be produced at real time speeds.

 Strain Limiting for Clustered Shape Matching  ##   Adam W.

The resulting approach resembles not only previous work on shape matching and strain limiting, but also the recently popular position-based dynamics.However, unlike this previous work, our approach reduces to explicit integration under small strains, but remains stable in the presence of non-linearities.

 Interactive Material Design Using Model Reduction  ##   Hongyi Xu, Yijing Li, Yong Chen, Jernej Barbic We demonstrate an interactive method to create heterogeneous continuous deformable materials on complex three-dimensional meshes. The user specifies displacements and internal elastic forces at a chosen set of mesh vertices. Our system then rapidly solves an optimization problem to compute a corresponding heterogeneous spatial distribution of material properties, using the Finite Element Method (FEM) analysis. We apply our method to linear and nonlinear isotropic deformable materials. We demonstrate that solving the problem interactively in the full-dimensional space of individual tetrahedron material values is not practical. Instead, we propose a new model reduction method that projects the material space to a low dimensional space of material modes. Our model reduction accelerates optimization by two orders of magnitude, and makes the convergence much more robust, making it possible to interactively design material distributions on complex meshes.We apply our method to precise control of contact forces and control of pressure over large contact areas between rigid and deformable objects for ergonomics. Our tetrahedron-based dithering method can efficiently convert continuous material distributions into discrete ones and we demonstrate its precision via FEM simulation. We physically display our distributions using haptics, as well as demonstrate how haptics can aid in the material design. The produced heterogeneous material distributions can also be used in computer animation applications.

 Yarn-Level Simulation of Woven Cloth  ##   Gabriel Cirio, Jorge Lopez-Moreno, David Miraut, Miguel A. Otaduy The large-scale mechanical behavior of woven cloth is determined by the mechanical properties of the yarns, the weave pattern, and frictional contact between yarns. Using standard simulation methods for elastic rod models and yarn-yarn contact handling, the simulation of woven garments at realistic yarn densities is deemed intractable. This paper introduces an efficient solution for simulating woven cloth at the yarn level. Central to our solution is a novel discretization of interlaced yarns based on yarn crossings and yarn sliding, which allows modeling yarn-yarn contact implicitly, avoiding contact handling at yarn crossings altogether. Combined with models for internal yarn forces and inter-yarn frictional contact, as well as a massively parallel solver, we are able to simulate garments with hundreds of thousands of yarn crossings at practical framerates on a desktop machine, showing combinations of large-scale and fine-scale effects induced by yarn-level mechanics.

 A Dimension-reduced Pressure Solver for Liquid Simulations  ##   Ryoichi Ando, Nils Thuerey, Chris Wojtan This work presents a method for efficiently simplifying the pressure projection step in a liquid simulation. We first devise a straightforward dimension reduction technique that dramatically reduces the cost of solving the pressure projection. Next, we introduce a novel change of basis that satisfies free-surface boundary conditions {\em exactly}, regardless of the accuracy of the pressure solve. When combined, these ideas greatly reduce the computational complexity of the pressure solve without compromising free surface boundary conditions at the highest level of detail. Our techniques are easy to parallelize, and they effectively eliminate the computational bottleneck for large liquid simulations.

 Implicit Formulation for SPH-Based Viscous Fluids  ##   Tetsuya Takahashi, Yoshinori Dobashi, Issei Fujishiro, Tomoyuki Nishita, Ming C. Lin We propose a stable and efficient particle-based method for simulating highly viscous fluids that can generate coiling and buckling phenomena and handle variable viscosity. In contrast to previous methods that use explicit integration, our method uses an implicit formulation to improve the robustness of viscosity integration, therefore enabling use of larger time steps and higher viscosities. We use Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics to solve the full form of viscosity, constructing a sparse linear system with a symmetric positive definite matrix, while exploiting the variational principle that automatically enforces the boundary condition on free surfaces. We also propose a new method for extracting coefficients of the matrix contributed by second-ring neighbor particles to efficiently solve the linear system using a conjugate gradient solver. Several examples demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of our implicit formulation over previous methods and illustrate the versatility of our method.

 Scalable Partitioning for Parallel Position Based Dynamics  ##   Marco Fratarcangeli, Fabio Pellacini We introduce a practical partitioning technique designed for parallelizing Position Based Dynamics, and exploit- ing the ubiquitous multi-core processors present in current commodity GPUs. The input is a set of particles whose dynamics is influenced by spatial constraints. In the initialization phase, we build a graph in which each node corresponds to a constraint and two constraints are connected by an edge if they influence at least one com- mon particle. We introduce a novel greedy algorithm for inserting additional constraints (phantoms) in the graph such that the resulting topology is qˆ-colourable, where qˆ ≥ 2 is an arbitrary number. We color the graph, and the constraints with the same color are assigned to the same partition. Then, the set of constraints belonging to each partition is solved in parallel during the animation phase. We demonstrate this by using our partitioning technique; the performance hit caused by the GPU kernel calls is significantly decreased, leaving unaffected the visual quality, robustness and speed of serial position based dynamics.

 Power particles: An incompressible fluid solver based on power diagrams  ##   Fernando de Goes, Corentin Wallez, Jin Huang, Dmitry Pavlov, Mathieu Desbrun This paper introduces a new particle-based approach to incompressible fluid simulation. We depart from previous Lagrangian methods by considering fluid particles no longer purely as material points, but also as volumetric parcels that partition the fluid domain. The fluid motion is described as a time series of well-shaped power diagrams (hence the name power particles), offering evenly spaced particles and accurate pressure computations. As a result, we circumvent the typical excess damping arising from kernel-based evaluations of internal forces or density without having recourse to auxiliary Eulerian grids. The versatility of our solver is demonstrated by the simulation of multiphase flows and free surfaces.

 Restoring the Missing Vortices in Advection-Projection Fluid Solvers  ##   Xinxin Zhang, Robert Bridson, Chen Greif Most visual effects fluid solvers use a time-splitting approach where velocity is first advected in the flow, then projected to be incompressible with pressure. Even if a highly accurate advection scheme is used, the self-advection step typically transfers some kinetic energy from divergence-free modes into divergent modes, which are then projected out by pressure, losing energy noticeably for large time steps. Instead of taking smaller time steps or using significantly more complex time integration, we propose a new scheme called IVOCK (Integrated Vorticity of Convective Kinematics) which cheaply captures much of what is lost in self-advection by identifying it as a violation of the vorticity equation. We measure vorticity on the grid before and after advection, taking into account vortex stretching, and use a cheap multigrid V-cycle approximation to a vector potential whose curl will correct the vorticity error. IVOCK works independently of the advection scheme (we present examples with various semi-Lagrangian methods and FLIP), works independently of how boundary conditions are applied (it just corrects error in advection, leaving pressure etc.\ to take care of boundaries and other forces), and other solver parameters (we provide smoke, fire, and water examples). For 10~25% extra computation time per step much larger steps can be used, while producing detailed vorticial structures and convincing turbulence that are lost without correction.

 Subspace Condensation: Full Space Adaptivity for Subspace Deformations  ##   Yun Teng, Mark Meyer, Tony DeRose, Theodore Kim Subspace deformable body simulations can be very fast, but can behave unrealistically when behaviors outside the prescribed subspace, such as novel external collisions, are encountered. We address this limitation by presenting a fast, flexible new method that allows full space computation to be activated in the neighborhood of novel events while the rest of the body still computes in a subspace. We achieve this using a method we call subspace condensation, a variant on the classic static condensation precomputation. However, instead of a precomputation, we use the speed of subspace methods to perform the condensation at every frame. This approach allows the full space regions to be specified arbitrarily at runtime, and forms a natural two-way coupling with the subspace regions. While condensation is usually only applicable to linear materials, the speed of our technique enables its application to non-linear materials as well. We show the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to a variety of articulated character scenarios.

 Double Bubbles Sans Toil and Trouble: Discrete Circulation-Preserving Vortex Sheets for Soap Films and Foams  ##   Fang Da, Christopher Batty, Chris Wojtan, Eitan Grinspun Simulating the delightful dynamics of soap films, bubbles, and foams has traditionally required the use of a fully three-dimensional many-phase Navier-Stokes solver, even though their visual appearance is completely dominated by the thin liquid surface. We depart from earlier work on soap bubbles and foams by noting that their dynamics are naturally described by a Lagrangian vortex sheet model in which circulation is the primary variable. This leads us to derive a novel circulation-preserving surface-only discretization of foam dynamics driven by surface tension on a non-manifold triangle mesh. We represent the surface using a mesh-based multimaterial surface tracker which supports complex bubble topology changes, and evolve the surface according to the ambient air flow induced by a scalar circulation field stored on the mesh. Surface tension forces give rise to a simple update rule for circulation, even at non-manifold Plateau borders, based on a discrete measure of signed scalar mean curvature. We further incorporate vertex constraints to enable the interaction of soap films with wires. The result is a method that is at once simple, robust, and efficient, yet able to capture an array of soap films behaviors including foam rearrangement, catenoid collapse, blowing bubbles, and double bubbles being pulled apart.

 A Stream Function Solver for Liquid Simulations  ##   Ryoichi Ando, Nils Thuerey, Chris Wojtan This paper presents a liquid simulation technique that enforces the incompressibility condition using a stream function solve instead of a pressure projection. Previous methods have used stream function techniques for the simulation of detailed single-phase flows, but a formulation for liquid simulation has proved elusive in part due to the free surface boundary conditions. In this paper, we introduce a stream function approach to liquid simulations with novel boundary conditions for free surfaces, solid obstacles, and solid-fluid coupling. Although our approach increases the dimension of the linear system necessary to enforce incompressibility, it provides interesting and surprising benefits. First, the resulting flow is guaranteed to be divergence-free regardless of the accuracy of the solve. Second, our free-surface boundary conditions guarantee divergence-free motion even in the un-simulated air phase, which enables two-phase flow simulation by only computing a single phase. We implemented this method using a variant of FLIP simulation which only samples particles within a narrow band of the liquid surface, and we illustrate the effectiveness of our method for detailed two-phase flow simulations with complex boundaries, detailed bubble interactions, and two-way solid-fluid coupling.

 Air Meshes for Robust Collision Handling  ##   Matthias Mueller, Nuttapong Chentanez, Tae-Yong Kim, Miles Macklin We propose a new method for both collision detection and collision response geared towards handling complex deformable objects in close contact. Our method does not miss collision events between time steps and solves the challenging problem of untangling automatically and robustly. It is conceptually simple and straight forward to parallelize due to the regularity of the algorithm. The main idea is to tessellate the air between objects once before the simulation and by considering one unilateral constraint per element that prevents its inversion during the simulation. If large relative rotations and translations are present in the simulation, an additional dynamic mesh optimization step is needed to prevent mesh locking. This step is fast in 2D and allows the simulation of arbitrary scenes. Because mesh optimization is expensive in 3D, however, the method is best suited for the subclass of 3D scenarios in which relative motions are limited. This subclass contains two important problems, namely the simulation of multi-layered clothing and tissue on animated characters.

 Fast Grid-Free Surface Tracking  ##   Nuttapong Chentanez, Matthias Mueller, Miles Macklin, Tae-Yong Kim We present a novel explicit surface tracking method. Its main advantage over existing approaches is the fact that it is both completely grid-free and fast which makes it ideal for the use in large unbounded domains. A further advantage is that its running time is less sensitive to temporal variations of the input mesh than existing approaches. In terms of performance, the method provides a good trade-off point between speed and quality. The main idea behind our approach to handle topological changes is to delete all overlapping triangles and to fill or join the resulting holes in a robust and efficient way while guaranteeing that the output mesh is both manifold and without boundary. We demonstrate the flexibility, speed and quality of our method in various applications such as Eulerian and Lagrangian liquid simulations and the simulation of solids under large plastic deformations.

 Co-Dimensional Non-Newtonian Fluids  ##   Bo Zhu, Minjae Lee, Ed Quigley, Ronald Fedkiw We present a novel method to simulate codimensional nonNewtonian fluids on simplicial complexes. Our method extends previous work for codimensional incompressible flow to various types of non-Newtonian fluids including both shear thinning and thickening, Bingham plastics, and elastoplastics. We propose a novel time integration scheme for semi-implicitly treating elasticity, which when combined with a semi-implicit method for variable viscosity alleviates the need for small time steps. Furthermore, we propose an improved treatment of viscosity on the rims of thin fluid sheets that allows us to capture their elusive, visually appealing twisting motion. In order to simulate complex phenomena such as the mixing of colored paint, we adopt a multiple level set framework and propose a discretization on simplicial complexes that facilitates the tracking of material interfaces across codimensions. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by simulating a wide variety of non-Newtonian fluid phenomena exhibiting various codimensional features.

 Deformation Capture and Modeling of Soft Objects  ##   Bin Wang, Longhua Wu, Kangkang Yin, Uri Ascher, Libin Liu, Hui Huang We present a data-driven method for the deformation capture and physics-based modeling of soft deformable objects. Our framework enables both realistic motion reconstruction and synthesis of virtual soft object models in response to user stimulation. Low cost depth sensors are used for the deformation capture, and we do not insist on any force-displacement measurements which are commonly required by previous work, thus making the capturing a cheap and convenient process. A physics-based probabilistic tracking method is employed to increase the tracking robustness to noise, occlusions, fast movements and large deformations. The deformation estimation task that includes the reference shape, material elasticity parameters and damping coefficient is then formulated and solved as a spacetime optimization problem, aiming at matching the simulated trajectories with the tracked ones. The optimized deformation parameters are used in turn to make the physics-based tracking results more accurate, consequently improving the deformation estimation itself. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our physics-based deformation tracking and deformation parameter optimization can be unified and made complementary to each other. The obtained optimal deformation parameters can yield high quality animations for various soft models.

 The Affine Particle-In-Cell Method  ##   Chenfanfu Jiang, Craig Schroeder, Andrew Selle, Joseph Teran, Alexey Stomakhin Hybrid Lagrangian/Eulerian simulation is commonplace in computer graphics for fluids and other materials undergoing large deformation. In these methods, particles are used to resolve transport and topological change, while a background Eulerian grid is used for computing mechanical forces and collision responses. Particle- in-Cell (PIC) techniques, particularly the Fluid Implicit Particle (FLIP) variants have become the norm in computer graphics calculations. While these approaches have proven very powerful, they do suffer from some well known limitations. The original PIC is stable, but highly dissipative, while FLIP, designed to remove this dissipation, is more noisy and at times, unstable. We present a novel technique designed to retain the stability of the original PIC, with- out suffering from the noise and instability of FLIP. Our primary observation is that the dissipation in the original PIC results from a loss of information when transferring between grid and particle representations. We prevent this loss of information by augmenting each particle with a locally affine, rather than locally constant, description of the velocity. We show that this not only stably removes the dissipation of PIC, but that it also allows for exact conservation of angular momentum across the transfers between particles and grid.

 Simulating Rigid Body Fracture with Surface Meshes  ##   Yufeng Zhu, Robert Bridson, Chen Greif We present a new brittle fracture simulation method based on a boundary integral formulation of elasticity and recent explicit surface mesh evolution algorithms. Unlike prior physically-based simulations in graphics, this avoids the need for volumetric sampling and calculations, which aren’t reflected in the rendered output. We represent each quasi-rigid body by a closed triangle mesh of its boundary, on which we solve quasi-static linear elasticity via boundary integrals in response to boundary conditions and loads such as impact forces and gravity. A fracture condition based on maximum tensile stress is subsequently evaluated at mesh vertices, while crack initiation and propagation are formulated as an interface tracking procedure in material space. Existing explicit mesh tracking methods are modified to support evolving cracks directly in the triangle mesh representation, giving highly detailed fractures with sharp features, independent of any volumetric sampling (unlike tetrahedral mesh or level set approaches); the triangle mesh representation also allows simple integration into rigid body engines. We also give details on our well-conditioned integral equation treatment solved with a kernel-independent Fast Multipole Method for linear time summation. Various brittle fracture scenarios demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of our new method.

 Continuum Foam: A Material Point Method for Shear-Dependent Flows  ##   Yonghao Yue, Breannan Smith, Christopher Batty, Changxi Zheng, Eitan Grinspun We consider the simulation of dense foams composed of microscopic bubbles, such as shaving cream and whipped cream. We represent foam not as a collection of discrete bubbles, but instead as a continuum. We employ the Material Point Method (MPM) to discretize a hyperelastic constitutive relation augmented with the Herschel-Bulkley model of non-Newtonian plastic flow, which is known to closely approximate foam behavior. Since large shearing flows in foam can produce poor distributions of material points, a typical MPM implementation can produce non-physical internal holes in the continuum. To address these artifacts, we introduce a particle resampling method for MPM. In addition, we introduce an explicit tearing model to prevent regions from shearing into artificially-thin, honey-like threads. We evaluate our method’s efficacy by simulating a number of dense foams, and we validate our method by comparing to real-world footage of foam.

 GRIDiron: An interactive authoring and cognitive training foundation for reconstructive plastic surgery procedures  ##   Nathan Mitchell, Court Cutting, Eftychios Sifakis We present an interactive simulation framework for authoring surgical procedures of soft tissue manipulation using physics-based simulation to animate the flesh. This interactive authoring tool can be used by clinical educators to craft three-dimensional illustrations of the intricate maneuvers involved in craniofacial repairs, in contrast to two-dimensional sketches and still photographs which are the medium used to describe these procedures in the traditional surgical curriculum. Our virtual environment also allows surgeons-intraining to develop cognitive skills for craniofacial surgery by experimenting with different approaches to reconstructive challenges, adapting stock techniques to flesh regions with nonstandard shape, and reach preliminary predictions about the feasibility of a given repair plan. We use a Cartesian grid-based embedded discretization of nonlinear elasticity to maximize regularity, and expose opportunities for aggressive multithreading and SIMD accelerations. Using a grid-based approach facilitates performance and scalability, but constrains our ability to capture the topology of thin surgical incisions. We circumvent this restriction by hybridizing the grid-based discretization with an explicit hexahedral mesh representation in regions where the embedding mesh necessitates overlap or nonmanifold connectivity. Finally, we detail how the front-end of our system can run on lightweight clients, while the core simulation capability can be hosted on a dedicated server and delivered as a network service.

 High-Resolution Brittle Fracture Simulation with Boundary Elements  ##   David Hahn, Chris Wojtan We present a method for simulating brittle fracture under the assumptions of quasi-static linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM). Using the boundary element method (BEM) and Lagrangian crack-fronts, we produce highly detailed fracture surfaces. The computational cost of the BEM is alleviated by using a low-resolution mesh and interpolating the resulting stress intensity factors when propagating the high-resolution crack-front. Our system produces physics-based fracture surfaces with high spatial and temporal resolution, taking spatial variation of material toughness and/or strength into account. It also allows for crack initiation to be handled separately from crack propagation, which is not only more reasonable from a physics perspective, but can also be used to control the simulation. Separating the resolution of the crack-front from the resolution of the computational mesh increases the efficiency and therefore the amount of visual detail on the resulting fracture surfaces. The BEM also allows us to re-use previously computed blocks of the system matrix.

 Stable Constrained Dynamics  ##   Maxime Tournier, Matthieu Nesme, Benjamin Gilles, Francois Faure We present a unification of the two main approaches to simulate deformable solids, namely elasticity and constraints. Elasticity accurately handles soft to moderately stiff objects, but becomes numerically hard as stiffness increases. Constraints efficiently handle high stiffness, but when integrated in time they can suffer from instabilities in the nullspace directions, generating spurious transverse vibrations when pulling hard on thin inextensible objects or articulated rigid bodies. We show that geometric stiffness, the tensor encoding the change of force directions (as opposed to intensities) in response to a change of positions, is the missing piece between the two approaches. This previously neglected stiffness term is easy to implement and dramatically improves the stability of inextensible objects and articulated chains, without adding artificial bending forces. This allows time step increases up to several orders of magnitude using standard linear solvers.

 Fluid Volume Modeling from Sparse Multi-view Images by Appearance Transfer  ##   Makoto Okabe, Yoshinori Dobashi, Ken Anjyo, Rikio Onai We propose a method of three-dimensional (3D) modeling of volumetric fluid phenomena from sparse multi-view images (e.g., only a single-view input or a pair of front- and side-view inputs). The volume determined from such sparse inputs using previous methods appears blurry and unnatural with novel views; however, our method preserves the appearance of novel viewing angles by transferring the appearance information from input images to novel viewing angles. For appearance information, we use histograms of image intensities and steerable coefficients. We formulate the volume modeling as an energy minimization problem with statistical hard constraints, which is solved using an expectation maximization (EM)-like iterative algorithm. Our algorithm begins with a rough estimate of the initial volume modeled from the input images, followed by an iterative process whereby we first render the images of the current volume with novel viewing angles. Then, we modify the rendered images by transferring the appearance information from the input images, and we thereafter model the improved volume based on the modified images. We iterate these operations until the volume converges. We demonstrate our method successfully provides natural-looking volume sequences of fluids (i.e., fire, smoke, explosions, and a water splash) from sparse multi-view videos. To create production-ready fluid animations, we further propose a method of rendering and editing fluids using a commercially available fluid simulator.

 An Implicit Viscosity Formulation for SPH Fluids  ##   Andreas Peer, Markus Ihmsen, Jens Cornelis, Matthias Teschner We present a novel implicit formulation for highly viscous fluids simulated with Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics SPH. Compared to explicit methods, our formulation is significantly more efficient and handles a larger range of viscosities. Differing from existing implicit formulations, our approach reconstructs the velocity field from a target velocity gradient. This gradient encodes a desired shear-rate damping and preserves the velocity divergence that is introduced by the SPH pressure solver to counteract density deviations. The target gradient ensures that pressure and viscosity computation do not interfere. Therefore, only one pressure projection step is required, which is in contrast to state-of-the-art implicit Eulerian formulations. While our model differs from true viscosity in that vorticity diffusion is not encoded in the target gradient, it nevertheless captures many of the qualitative behaviors of viscous liquids. Our formulation can easily be incorporated into complex scenarios with one- and two-way coupled solids and multiple fluid phases with different densities and viscosities.

 Nonlinear Material Design Using Principal Stretches  ##   Hongyi Xu, Funshing Sin, Yufeng Zhu, Jernej Barbic The Finite Element Method is widely used for solid deformable object simulation in film, computer games, virtual reality and medicine. Previous applications of nonlinear solid elasticity employed materials from a few standard families such as linear corotational, nonlinear St.Venant-Kirchhoff, Neo-Hookean, Ogden or Mooney-Rivlin materials. However, the spaces of all nonlinear isotropic and anisotropic materials are infinite-dimensional and much broader than these standard materials. In this paper, we demonstrate how to intuitively explore the space of isotropic and anisotropic nonlinear materials, for design of animations in computer graphics and related fields. In order to do so, we first formulate the internal elastic forces and tangent stiffness matrices in the space of the principal stretches of the material. We then demonstrate how to design new isotropic materials by editing a single stress-strain curve, using a spline interface. Similarly, anisotropic (orthotropic) materials can be designed by editing three curves, one for each material direction. We demonstrate that modifying these curves using our proposed interface has an intuitive, visual, effect on the simulation. Our materials accelerate simulation design and enable visual effects that are difficult or impossible to achieve with standard nonlinear materials.

 LazyFluids: Appearance Transfer for Fluid Animations  ##   Ondrej Jamriska, Jakub Fiser, Paul Asente, Jingwan Lu, Eli Shechtman, Daniel Sykora In this paper we present a novel approach to appearance transfer for fluid animations based on flow-guided texture synthesis. In contrast to common practice where pre-captured sets of fluid elements are combined in order to achieve desired motion and look, we bring the possibility of fine-tuning motion properties in advance using CG techniques, and then transferring the desired look from a selected appearance exemplar. We demonstrate that such a practical workflow cannot be simply implemented using current state-of-the-art techniques, analyze what the main obstacles are, and propose a solution to resolve them. In addition, we extend the algorithm to allow for synthesis with rich boundary effects and video exemplars. Finally, we present numerous results that demonstrate the versatility of the proposed approach.

 Multifarious Hierarchies of Mechanical Models for Artist Assigned Levels-of-Detail  ##   Richard Malgat, Benjamin Gilles, David I.W. Levin, Mathieu Nesme, Francois Faure We present a new framework for artist driven level of detail in solid simulations. Simulated objects are simultaneously embedded in several, separately designed deformation models with their own independent degrees of freedom. The models are ordered to apply their deformations hierarchically, and we enforce the uniqueness of the dynamics solutions using a novel kinetic filtering operator designed to ensure that each child only adds detail motion to its parent without introducing redundancies. This new approach allows artists to easily add fine-scale details without introducing unnecessary degrees-of-freedom to the simulation or resorting to complex geometric operations like anisotropic volume meshing. We illustrate the utility of our approach with several detail enriched simulation examples.

 Functional Thin Films on Surfaces  ##   Omri Azencot, Orestis Vantzos, Max Wardetzky, Martin Rumpf, Mirela Ben-Chen The motion of a thin viscous film of fluid on a curved surface exhibits many intricate visual phenomena, which are challenging to simulate using existing techniques. A possible alternative is to use a reduced model, involving only the temporal evolution of the mass density of the film on the surface. However, in this model, the motion is governed by a fourth-order nonlinear PDE, which involves geometric quantities such as the curvature of the underlying surface, and is therefore difficult to discretize. Inspired by a recent variational formulation for this problem on smooth surfaces, we present a corresponding model for triangle meshes. We provide a discretization for the curvature and advection operators which leads to an efficient and stable numerical scheme, requires a single sparse linear solve per time step, and exactly preserves the total volume of the fluid. We validate our method by qualitatively comparing to known results from the literature, and demonstrate various intricate effects achievable by our method, such as droplet formation, evaporation, droplets interaction and viscous fingering.

 Divergence-Free Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics  ##   Jan Bender, Dan Koschier In this paper we introduce an efficient and stable implicit SPH method for the physically-based simulation of incompressible fluids. In the area of computer graphics the most efficient SPH approaches focus solely on the correction of the density error to prevent volume compression. However, the continuity equation for incompressible flow also demands a divergence-free velocity field which is neglected by most methods. Although a few methods consider velocity divergence, they are either slow or have a perceivable density fluctuation. Our novel method uses an efficient combination of two pressure solvers which enforce low volume compression (below 0.01%) and a divergence-free velocity field. This can be seen as enforcing incompressibility both on position level and velocity level. The first part is essential for realistic physical behavior while the divergence-free state increases the stability significantly and reduces the number of solver iterations. Moreover, it allows larger time steps which yields a considerable performance gain since particle neighborhoods have to be updated less frequently. Therefore, our divergence-free SPH (DFSPH) approach is significantly faster and more stable than current state-of-the-art SPH methods for incompressible fluids. We demonstrate this in simulations with millions of fast moving particles.

 OmniAD: Data-driven Omni-directional Aerodynamics  ##   Tobias Martin, Nobuyuki Umetani, Bernd Bickel This paper introduces “OmniAD,” a novel data-driven pipeline to model and acquire the aerodynamics of three-dimensional rigid objects. Traditionally, aerodynamics are examined through elaborate wind tunnel experiments or expensive fluid dynamics computations, and are only measured for a small number of discrete wind directions. OmniAD allows the evaluation of aerodynamic forces, such as drag and lift, for any incoming wind direction using a novel representation based on spherical harmonics. Our datadriven technique acquires the aerodynamic properties of an object simply by capturing its falling motion using a single camera. Once model parameters are estimated, OmniAD enables realistic realtime simulation of rigid bodies, such as the tumbling and gliding of leaves, without simulating the surrounding air. In addition, we propose an intuitive user interface based on OmniAD to interactively design three-dimensional kites that actually fly. Various nontraditional kites were designed to demonstrate the physical validity of our model.

 Efficient Simulation of Knitted Cloth using Persistent Contacts  ##   Gabriel Cirio, Jorge Lopez-Moreno, Miguel Otaduy Knitted cloth is made of yarns that are stitched in regular patterns, and its macroscopic behavior is dictated by the contact interactions between such yarns. We propose an efficient representation of knitted cloth at the yarn level that treats yarn-yarn contacts as persistent, thereby avoiding expensive contact handling altogether. We introduce a compact representation of yarn geometry and kinematics, capturing the essential deformation modes of yarn loops and stitches with a minimum cost. Based on this representation, we design force models that reproduce the characteristic macroscopic behavior of knitted fabrics. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method on simulations with millions of degrees of freedom (hundreds of thousands of yarn loops), almost one order of magnitude faster than previous techniques.

 A Material Point Method for Viscoelastic Fluids, Foams, and Sponges  ##   Daniel Ram, Theodore Gast, Chenfanfu Jiang, Craig Schroeder, Alexey Stomakhin, Joseph Teran, Pirouz Kavehpour We present a new Material Point Method (MPM) for simulating viscoelastic fluids, foams and sponges. We design our discretization from the upper convected derivative terms in the evolution of the left Cauchy-Green elastic strain tensor. We combine this with an Oldroyd-B model for plastic flow in a complex viscoelastic fluid. While the Oldroyd-B model is traditionally used for viscoelastic fluids, we show that its interpretation as a plastic flow naturally allows us to simulate a wide range of complex material behaviors. In order to do this, we provide a modification to the traditional Oldroyd-B model that guarantees volume preserving plastic flows. Our plasticity model is remarkably simple (foregoing the need for the singular value decomposition (SVD) of stresses or strains). Lastly, we show that implicit time stepping can be achieved in a manner similar to [Stomakhin et al. 2013] and that this allows for high resolution simulations at practical simulation times.

 Real-time Dynamic Wrinkling of Coarse Animated Cloth  ##   Russell Gillette, Craig Peters, Nicholas Vining, Essex Edwards, Alla Sheffer Dynamic folds and wrinkles are an important visual cue for creating believably dressed characters in virtual environments. Adding these fine details to real-time cloth visualization is challenging, as the low-quality cloth used for real-time applications often has no reference shape, an extremely low triangle count, and poor temporal and spatial coherence. We introduce a novel real-time method for adding dynamic, believable wrinkles to such coarse cloth animation. We trace spatially and temporally coherent wrinkle paths, overcoming the inaccuracies and noise in low-end cloth animation, by employing a two stage stretch tensor estimation process. We first employ a graph-cut segmentation technique to extract spatially and temporally reliable surface motion patterns, detecting consistent compressing, stable, and stretching patches. We then use the detected motion patterns to compute a per-triangle temporally adaptive reference shape and a stretch tensor based on it. We use this tensor to dynamically generate new wrinkle geometry on the coarse cloth mesh by taking advantage of the GPU tessellation unit. Our algorithm produces plausible fine wrinkles on real-world data sets at real-time frame rates, and is suitable for the current generation of consoles and PC graphics cards.

Unfortunately, previous algorithms for accelerating three-dimensional finite element analysis of elastic objects suffer from expensive precomputation stages that rely on a priori knowledge of the object’s geometry and material composition. In this paper we introduce Data-Driven Finite Elements as a solution to this problem. Given a material palette, our method constructs a metamaterial library which is reusable for subsequent simulations, regardless of object geometry and/or material composition. At runtime, we perform fast coarsening of a simulation mesh using a simple table lookup to select the appropriate metamaterial model for the coarsened elements. When the object’s material distribution or geometry changes, we do not need to update the metamaterial library—we simply need to update the metamaterial assignments to the coarsened elements. An important advantage of our approach is that it is applicable to non-linear material models. This is important for designing objects that undergo finite deformation (such as those produced by multimaterial 3D printing). Our method yields speed gains of up to two orders of magnitude while maintaining good accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method on both virtual and 3D printed examples in order to show its utility as a tool for deformable object design.

 A Perceptual Control Space for Garment Simulation  ##   Leonid Sigal, Moshe Mahler, Spencer Diaz, Kyna McIntosh, Elizabeth Carter, Timothy Richards, Jessica Hodgins We present a perceptual control space for simulation of cloth that works with any physical simulator, treating it as a black box. The perceptual control space provides intuitive, art-directable control over the simulation behavior based on a learned mapping from common descriptors for cloth (e.g., flowiness, softness) to the parameters of the simulation. To learn the mapping, we perform a series of perceptual experiments in which the simulation parameters are varied and participants assess the values of the common terms of the cloth on a scale. A multi-dimensional sub-space regression is performed on the results to build a perceptual generative model over the simulator parameters. We evaluate the perceptual control space by demonstrating that the generative model does in fact create simulated clothing that is rated by participants as having the expected properties. We also show that this perceptual control space generalizes to garments and motions not in the original experiments.

 A New Sharp-Crease Bending Element for Folding and Wrinkling Surfaces and Volumes  ##   Saket Patkar, Ning Jin, Ronald Fedkiw We present a novel sharp-crease bending element for the folding and wrinkling of surfaces and volumes. Based on a control curve specified by an artist or derived from internal stresses of a simulation, we create a piecewise linear curve at the resolution of the computational mesh. Then, the key idea is to cut the object along the curve using the virtual node algorithm creating new degrees of freedom, while subsequently reattaching the resulting pieces eliminating the translational degrees of freedom so that adjacent pieces may only rotate or bend about the cut. Motivated by an articulated rigid body framework, we utilize the concepts of pre-stabilization and post-stabilization in order to enforce these reattachment constraints. Our cuts can be made either razor sharp or relatively smooth via the use of bending springs. Notably, our sharp-crease bending elements can not only be used to create pleats in cloth or folds in paper but also to create similar buckling in volumetric objects. We illustrate this with examples of forehead wrinkles and nasolabial folds for facial animation. Moreover, our sharp-crease bending elements require minimal extra simulation time as compared to the underlying mesh, and tend to reduce simulation times by an order of magnitude when compared to the alternative of mesh refinement.

 Fully Momentum-Conserving Reduced Deformable Bodies with Collision, Contact, Articulation, and Skinning  ##   Rahul Sheth, Wenlong Lu, Yue Yu, Ronald Fedkiw We propose a novel framework for simulating reduced deformable bodies that fully accounts for linear and angular momentum conservation even in the presence of collision, contact, articulation, and other desirable effects. This was motivated by the observation that the mere excitation of a single mode in a reduced degree of freedom model can adversely change the linear and angular momentum. Although unexpected changes in linear momentum can be avoided during basis construction, adverse changes in angular momentum appear unavoidable, and thus we propose a robust framework that includes the ability to compensate for them. Enabled by this ability to fully account for linear and angular momentum, we introduce an impulse-based formulation that allows us to precisely control the velocity of any node in spite of the fact that we only have access to a lower-dimensional set of degrees of freedom. This allows us to model collision, contact, and articulation in a robust and high visual fidelity manner, especially when compared to penalty-based forces that merely aim to coerce local velocities. In addition, we propose a new “deformable bones” framework wherein we leverage standard skinning technology for “bones,” “bone” placement, blending operations, etc. even though each of our “deformable bones” is a fully simulated reduced deformable model.

 Expediting Precomputation for Reduced Deformable Simulation  ##   Yin Yang, Dingzeyu Li, Weiwei Xu, Yuan Tian, Changxi Zheng Model reduction has popularized itself for simulating elastic deformation for graphics applications. While these techniques enjoy orders-of-magnitude speedups at runtime simulation, the efficiency of precomputing reduced subspaces remains largely overlooked. We present a complete system of precomputation pipeline as a faster alternative to the classic linear and nonlinear modal analysis. We identify three bottlenecks in the traditional model reduction precomputation, namely modal matrix construction, cubature training, and training dataset generation, and accelerate each of them. Even with complex deformable models, our method has achieved orders-of-magnitude speedups over the traditional precomputation steps, while retaining comparable runtime simulation quality.

 Surface Turbulence for Particle-Based Liquid Simulations  ##   Olivier Mercier, Cynthia Beauchemin, Nils Thuerey, Theodore Kim, Derek Nowrouzezahrai We present a method to increase the apparent resolution of particlebased liquid simulations. Our method first outputs a dense, temporally coherent, regularized point set from a coarse particle-based liquid simulation. We then apply a surface-only Lagrangian wave simulation to this high-resolution point set. We develop novel methods for seeding and simulating waves over surface points, and use them to generate high-resolution details. We avoid error-prone surface mesh processing, and robustly propagate waves without the need for explicit connectivity information. Our seeding strategy combines a robust curvature evaluation with multiple bands of seeding oscillators, injects waves with arbitrarily fine-scale structures, and properly handles obstacle boundaries. We generate detailed fluid surfaces from coarse simulations as an independent post-process that can be applied to most particle-based fluid solvers.

 A Unified Approach for Subspace Simulation of Deformable Bodies in Multiple Domains  ##   Xiaofeng Wu, Rajaditya Mukherjee, Huamin Wang Multi-domain subspace simulation can efficiently and conveniently simulate the deformation of a large deformable body, by constraining the deformation of each domain into a different subspace. The key challenge in implementing this method is how to handle the coupling among multiple deformable domains, so that the overall effect is free of gap or locking issues. In this paper, we present a new domain decomposition framework that connects two disjoint domains through coupling elements. Under this framework, we present a unified simulation system that solves subspace deformations and rigid motions of all of the domains by a single linear solve. Since the coupling elements are part of the deformable body, their elastic properties are the same as the rest of the body and our system does not need stiffness parameter tuning. To quickly evaluate the reduced elastic forces and their Jacobian matrices caused by the coupling elements, we further develop two cubature optimization schemes using uniform and non-uniform cubature weights. Our experiment shows that the whole system can efficiently handle large and complex scenes, many of which cannot be easily simulated by previous techniques without limitations A Unified Approach for Subspace Simulation of Deformable Bodies in Multiple Domains  A Unified Approach for Subspace Simulation of Deformable Bodies in Multiple Domains http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~whmin/publications.html   ## September 29th, 2015  ##  Deformables   ##  http://www.physicsbasedanimation.com/2015/09/29/a-unified-approach-for-subspace-simulation-of-deformable-bodies-in-multiple-domains/  
 A Chebyshev Semi-iterative Approach for Accelerating Projective and Position-based Dynamics  ##   Huamin Wang In this paper, we study the use of the Chebyshev semi-iterative approach in projective and position-based dynamics. Although projective dynamics is fundamentally nonlinear, its convergence behavior is similar to that of an iterative method solving a linear system. Because of that, we can estimate the “spectral radius” and use it in the Chebyshev approach to accelerate the convergence by at least one order of magnitude, when the global step is handled by the direct solver, the Jacobi solver, or even the Gauss-Seidel solver. Our experiment shows that the combination of the Chebyshev approach and the direct solver runs fastest on CPU, while the combination of the Chebyshev approach and the Jacobi solver outperforms any other combination on GPU, as it is highly compatible with parallel computing. Our experiment further shows position-based dynamics can be accelerated by the Chebyshev approach as well, although the effect is less obvious for tetrahedral meshes. The whole approach is simple, fast, effective, GPU-friendly, and has a small memory cost.

 Wetbrush: GPU-based 3D painting simulation at the bristle level  ##   Zhili Chen, Byungmoon Kim, Daichi Ito, Huamin Wang We present a real-time painting system that simulates the interactions among brush, paint, and canvas at the bristle level. The key challenge is how to model and simulate sub-pixel paint details, given the limited computational resource in each time step. To achieve this goal, we propose to define paint liquid in a hybrid fashion: the liquid close to the brush is modeled by particles, and the liquid away from the brush is modeled by a density field. Based on this representation, we develop a variety of techniques to ensure the performance and robustness of our simulator under large time steps, including brush and particle simulations in non-inertial frames, a fixed-point method for accelerating Jacobi iterations, and a new Eulerian-Lagrangian approach for simulating detailed liquid effects. The resulting system can realistically simulate not only the motions of brush bristles and paint liquid, but also the liquid transfer processes among different representations. We implement the whole system on GPU by CUDA. Our experiment shows that artists can use the system to draw realistic and vivid digital paintings, by applying the painting techniques that they are familiar with but not offered by many existing systems.

 Fast Multiple-Fluid Simulation Using Helmholtz Free Energy  ##   Tao Yang, Jian Chang, Bo Ren, Ming Lin, Jian Jun Zhang, Shi-Min Hu Multiple-fluid interaction is an interesting and common visual phenomenon we often observe. In this paper, we present an energybased Lagrangian method that expands the capability of existing multiple-fluid methods to handle various phenomena, such as extraction, partial dissolution, etc. Based on our user-adjusted Helmholtz free energy functions, the simulated fluid evolves from high-energy states to low-energy states, allowing flexible capture of various mixing and unmixing processes. We also extend the original Cahn-Hilliard equation to be better able to simulate complex fluid-fluid interaction and rich visual phenomena such as motionrelated mixing and position based pattern. Our approach is easily integrated with existing state-of-the-art smooth particle hydrodynamic (SPH) solvers and can be further implemented on top of the position based dynamics (PBD) method, improving the stability and incompressibility of the fluid during Lagrangian simulation under large time steps. Performance analysis shows that our method is at least 4 times faster than the state-of-the-art multiple-fluid method. Examples are provided to demonstrate the new capability and effectiveness of our approach.

 Model Reduced Variational Fluid Simulation  ##   Beibei Liu, Gemma Mason, Julian Hodgson, Yiying Tong, Mathieu Desbrun We present a model-reduced variational Eulerian integrator for incompressible fluids, which combines the efficiency gains of dimension reduction, the qualitative robustness of coarse spatial and temporal resolutions of geometric integrators, and the simplicity of sub-grid accurate boundary conditions on regular grids to deal with arbitrarily-shaped domains. At the core of our contributions is a functional map approach to fluid simulation for which scalar- and vector-valued eigenfunctions of the Laplacian operator can be easily used as reduced bases. Using a variational integrator in time to preserve liveliness and a simple, yet accurate embedding of the fluid domain onto a Cartesian grid, our model-reduced fluid simulator can achieve realistic animations in significantly less computational time than full-scale non-dissipative methods but without the numerical viscosity from which current reduced methods suffer. We also demonstrate the versatility of our approach by showing how it easily extends to magnetohydrodynamics and turbulence modeling in 2D, 3D and curved domains.

 Quadratic Contact Energy Model for Multi-Impact Simulation  ##   Tianxiang Zhang, Sheng Li, Guoping Wang, Dinesh Manocha, Hanqiu Sun Simultaneous multi-impact simulation is a challenging problem in modeling collision for rigid bodies. There are several physical criteria for an ideal model of rigid body collision, but existing models generally fail to meet one or more of them. In order to reveal the inner process of potential energy variation, which is the physical fundamental of collision in a multi-impact system, we propose a novel quadratic contact energy model for rigid body simulation. Through constructing quadratic energy functions with respect to impulse, post-impact reactions of rigid bodies can be computed efficiently. Our model can fulfil all the physical criteria and can simulate various natural phenomena including wave effect in particular. Besides, our model has high compatibility to be embedded into the Linear Complementary Problem (LCP) easily and can provide feasible results with any restitution coefficient. With a solid physical base, our model can solve the simultaneous multi-impact problem efficiently with high fidelity and robustness, as demonstrated in the experiment results.

 An Efficient Boundary Handling with a Modified Density Calculation for SPH  ##   Makoto Fujisawa, Kenjiro T. Miura We propose a new boundary handling method for smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). Previous approaches required the use of boundary particles to prevent particles from sticking to the boundary. We address this issue by correcting the fundamental equations of SPH with the integration of a kernel function. Our approach is able to directly handle triangle mesh boundaries without the need for boundary particles. We also show how our approach can be integrated into a position-based fluid framework.

 Deformable Objects Collision Handling with Fast Convergence  ##   Siwang Li, Zherong Pan, Jin Huang,  Hujun Bao, Xiaogang Jin We present a stable and efficient simulator for deformable objects with collisions and contacts. For stability, an optimization derived from the implicit time integrator is solved in each timestep under the inequality constraints coming from collisions. To achieve fast convergence, we extend the MPRGP based solver from handling boxconstraints only to handling general linear constraints and prove its convergence. This generalization introduces a cost of solving dense linear systems in each step, but these systems can be reduced into diagonal ones for efficiency without affecting the general stability via pruning redundant collisions. Our solver is an order of magnitude faster, especially for elastic objects under large deformation compared with iterative constraint anticipation method (ICA), a typical method for stability. The efficiency, robustness and stability are further verified by our results.

 TightCCD: Efficient and Robust Continuous Collision Detection using Tight Error Bounds  ##   Zhendong Wang, Min Tang , Ruofeng Tong, and Dinesh Manocha We present a realtime and reliable continuous collision detection (CCD) algorithm between triangulated models that exploits the floating point hardware capability of current CPUs and GPUs. Our formulation is based on Bernstein Sign Classification that takes advantage of the geometry properties of Bernstein basis and Bézier curves to perform Boolean collision queries. We derive tight numerical error bounds on the computations and employ those bounds to design an accurate algorithm using finite-precision arithmetic. Compared with prior floatingpoint CCD algorithms, our approach eliminates all the false negatives and 90-95% of the false positives. We integrated our algorithm (TightCCD) with physically-based simulation system and observe speedups in collision queries of 5-15X compared with prior reliable CCD algorithms. Furthermore, we demonstrate its benefits in terms of improving the performance or robustness of cloth simulation systems.

 Non-manifold Level Sets: A multivalued implicit surface representation with applications to self-collision processing  ##   Nathan Mitchell, Mridul Aanjaneya, Rajsekhar Setaluri, Eftychios Sifakis Level sets have been established as highly versatile implicit surface representations, with widespread use in graphics applications including modeling and dynamic simulation. Nevertheless, level sets are often presumed to be limited, compared to explicit meshes, in their ability to represent domains with thin topological features (e.g. narrow slits and gaps) or, even worse, material overlap. Geometries with such features may arise from modeling tools that tolerate occasional self-intersections, fracture modeling algorithms that create narrow or zero-width cuts by design, or as transient states in collision processing pipelines for deformable objects. Converting such models to level sets can alter their topology if thin features are not resolved by the grid size. We argue that this ostensible limitation is not an inherent defect of the implicit surface concept, but a collateral consequence of the standard Cartesian lattice used to store the level set values. We propose storing signed distance values on a regular hexahedral mesh which can have multiple collocated cubic elements and non-manifold bifurcation to accommodate non-trivial topology. We show how such non-manifold level sets can be systematically generated from convenient alternative geometric representations. Finally we demonstrate how this representation can facilitate fast and robust treatment of self-collision in simulations of volumetric elastic deformable bodies.

 Smoothed Aggregation Multigrid for Cloth Simulation  ##   Rasmus Tamstorf, Toby Jones, Stephen F. McCormick Existing multigrid methods for cloth simulation are based on geometric multigrid. While good results have been reported, geometric methods are problematic for unstructured grids, widely varying material properties, and varying anisotropies, and they often have difficulty handling constraints arising from collisions. This paper applies the algebraic multigrid method known as smoothed aggregation to cloth simulation. This method is agnostic to the underlying tessellation, which can even vary over time, and it only requires the user to provide a fine-level mesh. To handle contact constraints efficiently, a prefiltered preconditioned conjugate gradient method is introduced. For highly efficient preconditioners, like the ones proposed here, prefiltering is essential, but, even for simple preconditioners, prefiltering provides significant benefits in the presence of many constraints. Numerical tests of the new approach on a range of examples confirm 6-8X speedups on a fully dressed character with 371k vertices, and even larger speedups on synthetic examples.

 Data-Driven Fluid Simulations using Regression Forests  ##   Ľubor Ladický, SoHyeon Jeong, Barbara Solenthaler, Marc Pollefeys, and Markus Gross Traditional fluid simulations require large computational resources even for an average sized scene with the main bottleneck being a very small time step size, required to guarantee the stability of the solution. Despite a large progress in parallel computing and efficient algorithms for pressure computation in the recent years, realtime fluid simulations have been possible only under very restricted conditions. In this paper we propose a novel machine learning based approach, that formulates physics-based fluid simulation as a regression problem, estimating the acceleration of every particle for each frame. We designed a feature vector, directly modelling individual forces and constraints from the Navier-Stokes equations, giving the method strong generalization properties to reliably predict positions and velocities of particles in a large time step setting on yet unseen test videos. We used a regression forest to approximate the behaviour of particles observed in the large training set of simulations obtained using a traditional solver. Our GPU implementation led to a speed-up of one to three orders of magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art position-based fluid solver and runs in real-time for systems with up to 2 million particles.

 Subspace Dynamic Simulation Using Rotation-Strain Coordinates  ##   Zherong Pan, Hujun Bao, Jin Huang In this paper, we propose a full featured and efficient subspace simulation method in the rotation-strain (RS) space for elastic objects. Sharply different from previous methods using the rotation-strain space, except for the ability to handle non-linear elastic materials and external forces, our method correctly formulates the kinetic energy, centrifugal and Coriolis forces which significantly reduces the dynamic artifacts. We show many techniques used in the Euclidean space methods, such as modal derivatives, polynomial and cubature approximation, can be adapted to our RS simulator. Carefully designed experiments show that the equation of motion in RS space has less non-linearity than its Euclidean counterpart, and as a consequence, our method has great advantages of lower dimension and computational complexity than state-of-the-art methods in the Euclidean space.

 Interactive Detailed Cutting of Thin Sheets  ##   Pierre-Luc Manteaux, Wei-Lun Sun, Francois Faure, Marie-Paule Cani, James F. O’Brien In this paper we propose a method for the interactive detailed cutting of deformable thin sheets. Our method builds on the ability of frame-based simulation to solve for dynamics using very few control frames while embedding highly detailed geometry – here an adaptive mesh that accurately represents the cut boundaries. Our solution relies on a non-manifold grid to compute shape functions that faithfully adapt to the topological changes occurring while cutting. New frames are dynamically inserted to describe new regions. We provide incremental mechanisms for updating simulation data, enabling us to achieve interactive rates. We illustrate our method with examples inspired by the traditional Kirigami artform.

Pai The tendons of the hand and other biomechanical systems form a complex network of sheaths, pulleys, and branches. By modeling these anatomical structures, we obtain realistic simulations of coordination and dynamics that were previously not possible. First, we introduce Eulerian-on-Lagrangian discretization of tendon strands, with a new selective quasistatic formulation that eliminates unnecessary degrees of freedom in the longitudinal direction, while maintaining the dynamic behavior in transverse directions. This formulation also allows us to take larger time steps. Second, we introduce two control methods for biomechanical systems: first, a general-purpose learning-based approach requiring no previous system knowledge, and a second approach using data extracted from the simulator. We use various examples to compare the performance of these controllers.

 Evaluation of Surface Tension Models for SPH-Based Fluid Animations Using a Benchmark Test  ##   Markus Huber, Stefan Reinhardt, Daniel Weiskopf, and Bernhard Eberhardt We evaluate surface tension models in particle-based fluid simulation systems using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) with a benchmark test. Our benchmark consists of three experiments and a set of analysis methods that are useful for the comparison of surface tension models. Although visual quality is of major interest and is considered as well, we suggest quantification methods for the properties of these models. The goal is to identify if a certain model is suitable for a given scenario and to be able to control the results in the creation of animations. We apply the proposed evaluation methods to three existing surface tension models in combination with different SPH techniques (WCSPH, PCISPH, and IISPH) and perform systematic tests to show the influence of different settings and parameter choices. The surface tension models are chosen from different classes: a pure inter-particle force model, a model based on surface curvature, and a model using a combination of these. Additionally, we present a simple modification to improve the quality of inter-particle force models.

 Grid-Free Surface Tracking on the GPU  ##   Nuttapong Chentanez, Matthias Mueller, Miles Macklin, Tae-Yong Kim We present the first mesh-based surface tracker that runs entirely on the GPU. The surface tracker is both completely grid-free and fast which makes it suitable for the use in a large, unbounded domain. The key idea for handling topological changes is to detect and delete overlapping triangles as well as triangles that lie inside the volume. The holes are then joined or closed in a robust and efficient manner. Good mesh quality is maintained by a mesh improvement algorithm. In this paper we describe how all these steps can be parallelized to run effi- ciently on a GPU. The surface tracker is guaranteed to produce a manifold mesh without boundary. Our results show the quality and efficiency of the method in both Eulerian and Lagrangian liquid simulations.

 Implicit Incompressible SPH on the GPU  ##   Prashant Goswami, André Eliasson, Pontus Franzén This paper presents CUDA-based parallelization of implicit incompressible SPH (IISPH) on the GPU. Along with the detailed exposition of our implementation, we analyze various components involved for their costs. We show that our CUDA version achieves near linear scaling with the number of particles and is faster than the multi-core parallelized IISPH on the CPU. We also present a basic comparison of IISPH with the standard SPH on GPU.

 Dyna: A Model of Dynamic Human Shape in Motion  ##   Gerard Pons-Moll, Javier Romero, Naureen Mahmood, and Michael J. Black To look human, digital full-body avatars need to have soft tissue deformations like those of real people. Current methods for physics simulation of soft tissue lack realism, are computationally expensive, or are hard to tune. Learning soft tissue motion from example, however, has been limited by the lack of dense, high-resolution, training data. We address this using a 4D capture system and a method for accurately registering 3D scans across time to a template mesh. Using over 40,000 scans of ten subjects, we compute how soft tissue motion causes mesh triangles to deform relative to a base 3D body model and learn a low-dimensional linear subspace approximating this soft-tissue deformation. Our model, called Dyna, relates the linear coefficients of this body surface deformation to the changing pose of the body. We learn a second-order auto-regressive model that predicts soft-tissue deformations based on previous deformations, the velocity and acceleration of the body, and the angular velocities and accelerations of the limbs. Dyna also models how deformations vary with a person’s body mass index (BMI), producing different deformations for people with different shapes. Dyna realistically represents the dynamics of soft tissue for previously unseen subjects and motions. Finally, we provide tools for animators to vary BMI to produce different effects, to selectively control the location and intensity of soft-tissue motions, and to apply the model to new, stylized characters.

 Ductile Fracture for Clustered Shape Matching  ##   Ben Jones, April Martin, Joshua A. Levine, Tamar Shinar, and Adam W. Bargteil In this paper, we incorporate ductile fracture into the clustered shape matching simulation framework for deformable bodies, thus filling a gap in the shape matching literature. Our plasticity and fracture models are inspired by the finite element literature on deformable bodies, but are adapted to the clustered shape matching framework. The resulting approach is fast, versatile, and simple to implement.

 Solving the Fluid Pressure Poisson Equation Using Multigrid—Evaluation and Improvements  ##   Christian Dick, Marcus Rogowsky, Rüdiger Westermann In many numerical simulations of fluids governed by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, the pressure Poisson equation needs to be solved to enforce mass conservation. Multigrid solvers show excellent convergence in simple scenarios, yet they can converge slowly in domains where physically separated regions are combined at coarser scales. Moreover, existing multigrid solvers are tailored to specific discretizations of the pressure Poisson equation, and they cannot easily be adapted to other discretizations. In this paper we analyze the convergence properties of existing multigrid solvers for the pressure Poisson equation in different simulation domains, and we show how to further improve the multigrid convergence rate by using a graph-based extension to determine the coarse grid hierarchy. The proposed multigrid solver is generic in that it can be applied to different kinds of discretizations of the pressure Poisson equation, by using solely the specification of the simulation domain and pre-assembled computational stencils. We analyze the proposed solver in combination with finite difference and finite volume discretizations of the pressure Poisson equation. Our evaluations show that, despite the common assumption, multigrid schemes can exploit their potential even in the most complicated simulation scenarios, yet this behavior is obtained at the price of higher memory consumption.

 CAMA: Contact-Aware Matrix Assembly with Unified Collision Handling for GPU-based Cloth Simulation  ##   Min Tang, Huamin Wang, Le Tang, Ruofeng Tong, Dinesh Manocha We present a novel GPU-based approach to robustly and efficiently simulate high-resolution and complexly layered cloth. The key component of our formulation is a parallelized matrix assembly algorithm that can quickly build a large and sparse matrix in a compressed format and accurately solve linear systems on GPUs. We also present a fast and integrated solution for parallel collision handling, including collision detection and response computations, which utilizes spatio-temporal coherence. We combine these algorithms as part of a new cloth simulation pipeline that incorporates contact forces into implicit time integration for collision avoidance. The entire pipeline is implemented on GPUs, and we evaluate its performance on complex benchmarks consisting of 100-300K triangles. In practice, our system takes a few seconds to simulate one frame of a complex cloth scene, which represents significant speedups over prior CPU and GPU-based cloth simulation systems.

 Narrow Band FLIP for Liquid Simulations  ##   Florian Ferstl, Ryoichi Ando, Chris Wojtan, Rudiger Westermann, Nils Thuerey The Fluid Implicit Particle method (FLIP) for liquid simulations uses particles to reduce numerical dissipation and provide important visual cues for events like complex splashes and small-scale features near the liquid surface. Unfortunately, FLIP simulations can be computationally expensive, because they require a dense sampling of particles to fill the entire liquid volume. Furthermore, the vast majority of these FLIP particles contribute nothing to the fluid’s visual appearance, especially for larger volumes of liquid. We present a method that only uses FLIP particles within a narrow band of the liquid surface, while efficiently representing the remaining inner volume on a regular grid. We show that a naive realization of this idea introduces unstable and uncontrollable energy fluctuations, and we propose a novel coupling scheme between FLIP particles and regular grid which overcomes this problem. Our method drastically reduces the particle count and simulation times while yielding results that are nearly indistinguishable from regular FLIP simulations. Our approach is easy to integrate into any existing FLIP implementation.

 Modeling and Estimation of Energy-Based Hyperelastic Objects  ##   Eder Miguel, David Miraut, Miguel A. Otaduy In this paper, we present a method to model hyperelasticity that is well suited for representing the nonlinearity of real-world objects, as well as for estimating it from deformation examples. Previous approaches suffer several limitations, such as lack of integrability of elastic forces, failure to enforce energy convexity, lack of robustness of parameter estimation, or difficulty to model cross-modal effects. Our method avoids these problems by relying on a general energy-based definition of elastic properties. The accuracy of the resulting elastic model is maximized by defining an additive model of separable energy terms, which allow progressive parameter estimation. In addition, our method supports efficient modeling of extreme nonlinearities thanks to energy-limiting constraints. We combine our energy-based model with an optimization method to estimate model parameters from force-deformation examples, and we show successful modeling of diverse deformable objects, including cloth, human finger skin, and internal human anatomy in a medical imaging application.

 A Practical Method for High-Resolution Embedded Liquid Surfaces  ##   Ryan Goldade, Christopher Batty, Chris Wojtan Combining high-resolution level set surface tracking with lower resolution physics is an inexpensive method for achieving highly detailed liquid animations. Unfortunately, the inherent resolution mismatch introduces several types of disturbing visual artifacts. We identify the primary sources of these artifacts and present simple, efficient, and practical solutions to address them. First, we propose an unconditionally stable filtering method that selectively removes sub-grid surface artifacts not seen by the fluid physics, while preserving fine detail in dynamic splashing regions. It provides comparable results to recent error-correction techniques at lower cost, without substepping, and with better scaling behavior. Second, we show how a modified narrow-band scheme can ensure accurate free surface boundary conditions in the presence of large resolution mismatches. Our scheme preserves the efficiency of the narrow-band methodology, while eliminating objectionable stairstep artifacts observed in prior work. Third, we demonstrate that the use of linear interpolation of velocity during advection of the high-resolution level set surface is responsible for visible grid-aligned kinks; we therefore advocate higher-order velocity interpolation, and show that it dramatically reduces this artifact. While these three contributions are orthogonal, our results demonstrate that taken together they efficiently address the dominant sources of visual artifacts arising with high-resolution embedded liquid surfaces; the proposed approach offers improved visual quality, a straightforward implementation, and substantially greater scalability than competing methods.

 Dexterous Manipulation of Cloth  ##   Yunfei Bai, Wenhao Yu, and C. Karen Liu This paper introduces a new technique to synthesize dexterous manipulation of cloth. Given a simple description of the desired cloth motion, our algorithm computes appropriate joint torques for physically simulated hands, such that, via contact forces, the result of cloth simulation follows the desired motion. Instead of optimizing the hand control forces directly, we formulate an optimization problem that solves for the commanding forces from the hands to the cloth, which have more direct impact on the dynamic state of the hands and that of the cloth. The solution of the optimization provides commanding forces that achieve the desired cloth motion described by the user, while respecting the kinematic constraints of the hands. These commanding forces are then used to guide the joint torques of the hands. To balance between the effectiveness of control and computational costs, we formulate a model-predictive-control problem as a quadratic program at each time step. We demonstrate our technique on a set of cloth manipulation tasks in daily activities, including folding laundry, wringing a towel, and putting on a scarf.

 Real-time Hair Mesh Simulation  ##   Kui Wu, Cem Yuksel We present a robust real-time hair simulation method using hair meshes. Leveraging existing simulation models for sheet-based cloth, we introduce a volumetric force model for incorporating hair interactions inside the hair mesh volume. We also introduce a position correction method that minimizes the local deformation of the hair mesh due to collision handling. We demonstrate the robustness of our hair simulation method using large time steps with fast motion, and we show that our method can recover the initial hair shape even when the hair mesh goes through substantial deformation.

 Liquid boundaries for implicit incompressible SPH  ##   Jens Cornelis, Markus Ihmsen, Andreas Peer, Matthias Teschner We propose a novel unified particle representation for fluids and solid boundaries in Implicit Incompressible SPH (IISPH). In contrast to existing particle representations, the proposed concept does not require a separate processing of fluid and boundary particles. On one hand, this results in a simplified solver implementation with improved efficiency. On the other hand, the unified fluid and boundary representation adds flexibility to IISPH which enables versatile effects. In particular, particles can now dynamically interchange their role between fluid and boundary which we therefore refer to as liquid boundary. The paper mainly focuses on the description of the unified representation and on the application of the concept to visual effects such as solidification and liquefaction. To support the realization of these effects, the concept of unified fluid and liquid boundary particles is extended to a third particle type, so-called candidate particles that are used in a transition phase between fluid and liquid boundaries.

 Simit: A Language for Physical Simulation  ##   Fredrik Kjolstad, Shoaib Kamil Jonathan Ragan-Kelley, David I.W. Levin,Shinjiro Sueda, Desai Chen, Etienne Vouga, Danny M. Kaufman, Gurtej Kanwar,Wojciech Matusik, and Saman Amarasinghe Using existing programming tools, writing high-performance simulation code is labor intensive and requires sacrificing readability and portability. The alternative is to prototype simulations in a high-level language like Matlab, thereby sacrificing performance. The Matlab programming model naturally describes the behavior of an entire physical system using the language of linear algebra. However, simulations also manipulate individual geometric elements, which are best represented using linked data structures like meshes. Translating between the linked data structures and linear algebra comes at significant cost, both to the programmer and the machine. High-performance implementations avoid the cost by rephrasing the computation in terms of linked or index data structures, leaving the code complicated and monolithic, often increasing its size by an order of magnitude. In this paper, we present Simit, a new language for physical simulations that lets the programmer view the system both as a linked data structure in the form of a hypergraph, and as a set of global vectors, matrices and tensors depending on what is convenient at any given time. Simit provides a novel assembly construct that makes it conceptually easy and computationally efficient to move between the two abstractions. Using the information provided by the assembly construct, the compiler generates efficient in-place computation on the graph. We demonstrate that Simit is easy to use: a Simit program is typically shorter than a Matlab program; that it is high-performance: a Simit program running sequentially on a CPU performs comparably to hand-optimized simulations; and that it is portable: Simit programs can be compiled for GPUs with no change to the program, delivering 4-20x speedups over our optimized CPU code.

 Interactively Cutting and Constraining Vertices in Meshes Using Augmented Matrices  ##   Yu-Hong Yeung, Jessica Crouch, Alex Pothen We present a finite element solution method that is well-suited for interactive simulations of cutting meshes in the regime of linear elastic models. Our approach features fast updates to the solution of the stiffness system of equations to account for real-time changes in mesh connectivity and boundary conditions. Updates are accomplished by augmenting the stiffness matrix to keep it consistent with the changes to the underlying model, without re-factoring the matrix at each step of cutting. The initial stiffness matrix and its Cholesky factors are used to implicitly form and solve a Schur complement system using an iterative solver. As changes accumulate over many simulation time steps, the augmented solution method slows down due to the size of the augmented matrix. However, by periodically re-factoring the stiffness matrix in a concurrent background process, fresh Cholesky factors that incorporate recent model changes can replace the initial factors. This controls the size of the augmented matrices and provides a way to maintain a fast solution rate as the number of changes to a model grows. We exploit sparsity in the stiffness matrix, the right-hand-side vectors and the solution vectors to compute the solutions fast, and show that the time complexity of the update steps is bounded linearly by the size of the Cholesky factor of the initial matrix. Our complexity analysis and experimental results demonstrate that this approach scales well with problem size. Results for cutting and deformation of 3D linear elastic models are reported for meshes representing the brain, eye, and model problems with element counts up to 167, 000; these show the potential of this method for real-time interactivity. An application to limbal incisions for surgical correction of astigmatism, where linear elastic models and small deformations are sufficient, is included.

 Boundary detection in particle-based fluids  ##   Marcos Sandim, Douglas Cedrim, Luis Gustavo Nonato, Paulo Pagliosa, and Afonso Paiva This paper presents a novel method to detect free-surfaces on particle-based volume representation. In contrast to most particle-based free-surface detection methods, which perform the surface identification based on physical and geometrical properties derived from the underlying fluid flow simulation, the proposed approach only demands the spatial location of the particles to properly recognize surface particles, avoiding even the use of kernels. Boundary particles are identified through a Hidden Point Removal (HPR) operator used for visibility test. Our method is very simple, fast, easy to implement and robust to changes in the distribution of particles, even when facing large deformation of the free-surface. A set of comparisons against state-of-the-art boundary detection methods show the effectiveness of our approach. The good performance of our method is also attested in the context of fluid flow simulation involving free-surface, mainly when using level-sets for rendering purposes.

 Ebb: A DSL for Physical Simulation on CPUs and GPUs  ##   Gilbert Bernstein, Chinmayee Shah, Crystal Lemire, Zachery DeVito, Matthew Fisher, Philip Levis, Pat Hanrahan Designing programming environments for physical simulation is challenging because simulations rely on diverse algorithms and geometric domains. These challenges are compounded when we try to run efficiently on heterogeneous parallel architectures. We present Ebb, a domain-specific language (DSL) for simulation, that runs efficiently on both CPUs and GPUs. Unlike previous DSLs, Ebb uses a three-layer architecture to separate (1) simulation code, (2) definition of data structures for geometric domains, and (3) runtimes supporting parallel architectures. Different geometric domains are implemented as libraries that use a common, unified, relational data model. By structuring the simulation framework in this way, programmers implementing simulations can focus on the physics and algorithms for each simulation without worrying about their implementation on parallel computers. Because the geometric domain libraries are all implemented using a common runtime based on relations, new geometric domains can be added as needed, without specifying the details of memory management, mapping to different parallel architectures, or having to expand the runtime’s interface. We evaluate Ebb by comparing it to several widely used simulations, demonstrating comparable performance to hand-written GPU code where available, and surpassing existing CPU performance optimizations by up to 9x when no GPU code exists.

 Resolving Fluid Boundary Layers with Particle Strength Exchange and Weak Adaptivity  ##   Xinxin Zhang, Minchen Li, Robert Bridson Most fluid scenarios in graphics have a high Reynolds number, where viscosity is dominated by inertial effects, thus most solvers drop viscosity altogether: numerical damping from coarse grids is generally stronger than physical viscosity while resembling it in character. However, viscosity remains crucial near solid boundaries, in the boundary layer, to a large extent determining the look of the flow as a function of Reynolds number. Typical graphics simulations do not resolve boundary layer dynamics, so their look is determined mostly by numerical errors with the given grid size and time step, rather than physical parameters. We introduce two complementary techniques to capture boundary layer dynamics, bringing more physical control and predictability. We extend the FLIP particle-grid method with viscous particle strength exchange[Rivoalen and Huberson 2001] to better transfer momentum at solid boundaries, dubbed VFLIP. We also introduce Weakly Higher Resolution Regional Projection (WHIRP), a cheap and simple way to increase grid resolution where important by overlaying high resolution grids on the global coarse grid.

 Drucker-Prager Elastoplasticity for Sand Animation  ##   Gergely Klar, Theodore Gast, Andre Pradhana, Chuyuan Fu, Craig Schroeder, Chenfanfu Jiang, Joseph Teran We simulate sand dynamics using an elastoplastic, continuum assumption. We demonstrate that the Drucker-Prager plastic flow model combined with a Hencky-strain-based hyperelasticity accurately recreates a wide range of visual sand phenomena with moderate computational expense. We use the Material Point Method (MPM) to discretize the governing equations for its natural treatment of contact, topological change and history dependent constitutive relations. The Drucker-Prager model naturally represents the frictional relation between shear and normal stresses through a yield stress criterion. We develop a stress projection algorithm used for enforcing this condition with a non-associative flow rule that works naturally with both implicit and explicit time integration. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on examples undergoing large deformation, collisions and topological changes necessary for producing modern visual effects.

 Surface-Only Liquids  ##   Fang Da, David Hahn, Christopher Batty, Chris Wojtan, Eitan Grinspun We propose a novel surface-only technique for simulating incompressible, inviscid and uniform-density liquids with surface tension in three dimensions. The liquid surface is captured by a triangle mesh on which a Lagrangian velocity field is stored. Because advection of the velocity field may violate the incompressibility condition, we devise an orthogonal projection technique to remove the divergence while requiring the evaluation of only two boundary integrals. The forces of surface tension, gravity, and solid contact are all treated by a boundary element solve, allowing us to perform detailed simulations of a wide range of liquid phenomena, including waterbells, droplet and jet collisions, fluid chains, and crown splashes.

Artist-directed dynamics seeks to resolve this need with a unified method that combines simulation with classical keyframing techniques.

Examining our system in the context of the twelve fundamental animation principles reveals that it stands out for its treatment of exaggeration and appeal. Our system accommodates abrupt jumps, large plastic deformations, and makes it easy to reuse carefully crafted animations.

 Adaptive Skinning for Interactive Hair-Solid Simulation  ##   Menglei Chai, Changxi Zheng and Kun Zhou Reduced hair models have proven successful for interactively simulating a full head of hair strands, building upon a fundamental assumption that only a small set of guide hairs are needed for explicit simulation, and the rest of the hair move coherently and thus can be interpolated using guide hairs. Unfortunately, hair-solid interactions is a pathological case for traditional reduced hair models, as the motion coherence between hair strands can be arbitrarily broken by interacting with solids. In this paper, we propose an adaptive hair skinning method for interactive hair simulation with hair-solid collisions. We precompute many eligible sets of guide hairs and the corresponding interpolation relationships that are represented using a compact strand-based hair skinning model. At runtime, we simulate only guide hairs; for interpolating every other hair, we adaptively choose its guide hairs, taking into account motion coherence and potential hair-solid collisions. Further, we introduce a two-way collision correction algorithm to allow sparsely sampled guide hairs to resolve collisions with solids that can have small geometric features. Our method enables interactive simulation of more than 150K hair strands interacting with complex solid objects, using 400 guide hairs. We demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the method with various hairstyles and user-controlled arbitrary hair-solid interactions.

 Physics-Driven Pattern Adjustment for Direct 3D Garment Editing  ##   Aric Bartle, Alla Sheffer, Vladimir G. Kim, Danny Kaufman, Nicholas Vining, Floraine Berthouzoz Designers frequently reuse existing designs as a starting point for creating new garments. In order to apply garment modifications, which the designer envisions in 3D, existing tools require meticulous manual editing of 2D patterns. These 2D edits need to account both for the envisioned geometric changes in the 3D shape, as well as for various physical factors that affect the look of the draped garment. We propose a new framework that allows designers to directly apply the changes they envision in 3D space; and creates the 2D patterns that replicate this envisioned target geometry when lifted into 3D via a physical draping simulation. Our framework removes the need for laborious and knowledge-intensive manual 2D edits and allows users to effortlessly mix existing garment designs as well as adjust for garment length and fit. Following each user specified editing operation we first compute a target 3D garment shape, one that maximally preserves the input garment’s style–its proportions, fit and shape–subject to the modifications specified by the user. We then automatically compute 2D patterns that recreate the target garment shape when draped around the input mannequin within a user-selected simulation environment. To generate these patterns, we propose a fixed-point optimization scheme that compensates for the deformation due to the physical forces affecting the drape and is independent of the underlying simulation tool used. Our experiments show that this method quickly and reliably converges to patterns that, under simulation, form the desired target look, and works well with different black-box physical simulators. We demonstrate a range of edited and resimulated garments, and further validate our approach via expert and amateur critique, and comparisons to alternative solutions.

Our simulation method does not require any skin data capture; hence, it can be applied to humans, animals, and arbitrary (real-world or fictional) characters. In standard model reduction of three-dimensional nonlinear solid elastic models, one builds a reduced model around a single pose, typically the rest configuration. We demonstrate how to perform multi-model reduction of Finite Element Method (FEM) nonlinear elasticity, where separate reduced models are precomputed around a representative set of object poses, and then combined at runtime into a single fast dynamic system, using subspace interpolation. While time-varying reduction has been demonstrated before for offline applications, our method is fast and suitable for hard real-time applications in games and virtual reality. Our method supports self-contact, which we achieve by computing linear modes and derivatives under contact constraints.

 A Semi-Implicit Material Point Method for the Continuum Simulation of Granular Materials  ##   Gilles Daviet, Florence Bertails-Descoubes We present a new continuum-based method for the realistic simulation of large-scale free-flowing granular materials. We derive a compact model for the rheology of the material, which accounts for the exact nonsmooth Drucker-Prager yield criterion combined with a varying volume fraction. Thanks to a semi-implicit timestepping scheme and a careful spatial discretization of our rheology built upon the Material-Point Method, we are able to preserve at each time step the exact coupling between normal and tangential stresses, in a stable way. This contrasts with previous approaches which either regularize or linearize the yield criterion for implicit integration, leading to unrealistic behaviors or visible grid artifacts. Remarkably, our discrete problem turns out to be very similar to the discrete contact problem classically encountered in multibody dynamics, which allows us to leverage robust and efficient nonsmooth solvers from the literature. We validate our method by successfully capturing typical macroscopic features of some classical experiments, such as the discharge of a silo or the collapse of a granular column. Finally, we show that our method can be easily extended to accommodate more complex scenarios including twoway rigid body coupling as well as anisotropic materials.

 Fast approximations for boundary element based brittle fracture simulation  ##   David Hahn, Chris Wojtan We present a boundary element based method for fast simulation of brittle fracture. By introducing simplifying assumptions that allow us to quickly estimate stress intensities and opening displacements during crack propagation, we build a fracture algorithm where the cost of each time step scales linearly with the length of the crack-front. The transition from a full boundary element method to our faster variant is possible at the beginning of any time step. This allows us to build a hybrid method, which uses the expensive but more accurate BEM while the number of degrees of freedom is low, and uses the fast method once that number exceeds a given threshold as the crack geometry becomes more complicated. Furthermore, we integrate this fracture simulation with a standard rigid-body solver. Our rigid-body coupling solves a Neumann boundary value problem by carefully separating translational, rotational and deformational components of the collision forces and then applying a Tikhonov regularizer to the resulting linear system. We show that our method produces physically reasonable results in standard test cases and is capable of dealing with complex scenes faster than previous finite- or boundary element approaches.

 Example-Based Plastic Deformation of Rigid Bodies  ##   Ben Jones, Nils Thuerey, Tamar Shinar, Adam W. Bargteil Physics-based animation is often used to animate scenes containing destruction of near-rigid, man-made materials. For these applications, the most important visual features are plastic deformation and fracture. Methods based on continuum mechanics model these materials as elastoplastic, and must perform expensive elasticity computations even though elastic deformations are imperceptibly small for rigid materials. We introduce an example-based plasticity model based on linear blend skinning that allows artists to author simulation objects using familiar tools. Dynamics are computed using an unmodified rigid body simulator, making our method computationally efficient and easy to integrate into existing pipelines. We introduce a flexible technique for mapping impulses computed by the rigid body solver to local, example-based deformations. For completeness, our method also supports prescoring based fracture. We demonstrate the practicality of our method by animating a variety of destructive scenes.

 Generalized Non-Reflecting Boundaries for Fluid Re-Simulation  ##   Morten Bojsen-Hansen, Chris Wojtan When aiming to seamlessly integrate a fluid simulation into a larger scenario (like an open ocean), careful attention must be paid to boundary conditions. In particular, one must implement special “non-reflecting” boundary conditions, which dissipate out-going waves as they exit the simulation. Unfortunately, the state of the art in non-reflecting boundary conditions (perfectly-matched layers, or PMLs) only permits trivially simple inflow/outflow conditions, so there is no reliable way to integrate a fluid simulation into a more complicated environment like a stormy ocean or a turbulent river. This paper introduces the first method for combining non-reflecting boundary conditions based on PMLs with inflow/outflow boundary conditions that vary arbitrarily throughout space and time. Our algorithm is a generalization of state-of-the-art mean-flow boundary conditions in the computational fluid dynamics literature, and it allows for seamless integration of a fluid simulation into much more complicated environments. Our method also opens the door for previously-unseen post-process effects like retroactively changing the location of solid obstacles, and locally increasing the visual detail of a pre-existing simulation.

 Schrödinger’s Smoke  ##   Albert Chern, Felix Knoppel, Ulrich Pinkall, Peter Schröder, Steffen Weissmann We describe a new approach for the purely Eulerian simulation of incompressible fluids. In it, the fluid state is represented by a ℂ²-valued wave function evolving under the Schrödinger equation subject to incompressibility constraints. The underlying dynamical system is Hamiltonian and governed by the kinetic energy of the fluid together with an energy of Landau-Lifshitz type. The latter ensures that dynamics due to thin vortical structures, all important for visual simulation, are faithfully reproduced. This enables robust simulation of intricate phenomena such as vortical wakes and interacting vortex filaments, even on modestly sized grids. Our implementation uses a simple splitting method for time integration, employing the FFT for Schrödinger evolution as well as constraint projection. Using a standard penalty method we also allow arbitrary obstacles. The resulting algorithm is simple, unconditionally stable, and efficient. In particular it does not require any Lagrangian techniques for advection or to counteract the loss of vorticity. We demonstrate its use in a variety of scenarios, compare it with experiments, and evaluate it against benchmark tests. A full implementation is included in the ancillary materials.

 Non-smooth developable geometry for interactively animating paper crumpling  ##   Camille Schreck, Damien Rohmer, Stefanie Hahmann, Marie-Paule Cani, Shuo Jin, Charlie Wang, Jean-Francois Bloch We present the first method to animate sheets of paper at interactive rates, while automatically generating a plausible set of sharp features when the sheet is crumpled. The key idea is to interleave standard physically-based simulation steps with procedural generation of a piecewise continuous developable surface. The resulting hybrid surface model captures new singular points dynamically appearing during the crumpling process, mimicking the effect of paper fiber fracture. Although the model evolves over time to take these irreversible damages into account, the mesh used for simulation is kept coarse throughout the animation, leading to efficient computations. Meanwhile, the geometric layer ensures that the surface stays almost isometric to its original 2D pattern. We validate our model through measurements and visual comparison with real paper manipulation, and show results on a variety of crumpled paper configurations.

 Multiphase SPH Simulation for Interactive Fluids and Solids  ##   Xiao Yan, Yun-Tao Jiang, Chen-Feng Li, Ralph R. Martin, and Shi-Min Hu This work extends existing multiphase-fluid SPH frameworks to cover solid phases, including deformable bodies and granular materials. In our extended multiphase SPH framework, the distribution and shapes of all phases, both fluids and solids, are uniformly represented by their volume fraction functions. The dynamics of the multiphase system is governed by conservation of mass and momentum within different phases. The behavior of individual phases and the interactions between them are represented by corresponding constitutive laws, which are functions of the volume fraction fields and the velocity fields. Our generalized multiphase SPH framework does not require separate equations for specific phases or tedious interface tracking. As the distribution, shape and motion of each phase is represented and resolved in the same way, the proposed approach is robust, efficient and easy to implement. Various simulation results are presented to demonstrate the capabilities of our new multiphase SPH framework, including deformable bodies, granular materials, interaction between multiple fluids and deformable solids, flow in porous media, and dissolution of deformable solids.

 Preserving Geometry and Topology for Fluid Flows  with Thin Obstacles and Narrow Gaps  ##   Vinicius C. Azevedo, Christopher Batty, Manuel M. Oliveira Fluid animation methods based on Eulerian grids have long struggled to resolve flows involving narrow gaps and thin solid features. Past approaches have artificially inflated or voxelized boundaries, although this sacrifices the correct geometry and topology of the fluid domain and prevents flow through narrow regions. We present a boundary-respecting fluid simulator that overcomes these challenges. Our solution is to intersect the solid boundary geometry with the cells of a background regular grid to generate a topologically correct, boundary-conforming cut-cell mesh. We extend both pressure projection and velocity advection to support this enhanced grid structure. For pressure projection, we introduce a general graph-based scheme that properly preserves discrete incompressibility even in thin and topologically complex flow regions, while nevertheless yielding symmetric positive definite linear systems. For advection, we exploit polyhedral interpolation to improve the degree to which the flow conforms to irregular and possibly non-convex cell boundaries, and propose a modified PIC/FLIP advection scheme to eliminate the need to inaccurately reinitialize invalid cells that are swept over by moving boundaries. The method naturally extends the standard Eulerian fluid simulation framework, and while we focus on thin boundaries, our contributions are beneficial for volumetric solids as well. Our results demonstrate successful one-way fluid-solid coupling in the presence of thin objects and narrow flow regions even on very coarse grids.

 Hele-Shaw Flow Simulation with Interactive Control using Complex Barycentric Coordinates  ##   Aviv Segall, Orestis Vantzos, Mirela Ben-Chen Hele-Shaw flow describes the slow flow of a viscous liquid between two parallel plates separated by a small gap. In some configurations such a flow generates instabilities known as Saffman-Taylor fingers, which form intricate visual patterns. While these patterns have been an inspiration for artists, as well as thoroughly analyzed by mathematicians, efficiently simulating them remains challenging. The main difficulty involves efficiently computing a harmonic function on a time-varying planar domain, a problem which has been recently addressed in the shape deformation literature using a complex-variable formulation of generalized barycentric coordinates. We propose to leverage similar machinery, and show how the model equations for the Hele-Shaw flow can be formulated in this framework. This allows us to efficiently simulate the flow, while allowing interactive user control of the behavior of the fingers. We additionally show that complex barycentric coordinates are applicable to the exterior domain, and use them to simulate two-phase flow, yielding a variety of interesting patterns.

 Hierarchical hp-Adaptive Signed Distance Fields  ##   Dan Koschier, Crispin Deul, Jan Bender In this paper we propose a novel method to construct hierarchical $hp$-adaptive Signed Distance Fields (SDFs). We discretize the signed distance function of an input mesh using piecewise polynomials on an axis-aligned hexahedral grid. Besides spatial refinement based on octree subdivision to refine the cell size (h), we hierarchically increase each cell’s polynomial degree (p) in order to construct a very accurate but memory-efficient representation. Presenting a novel criterion to decide whether to apply h- or p-refinement, we demonstrate that our method is able to construct more accurate SDFs at significantly lower memory consumption than previous approaches. Finally, we demonstrate the usage of our representation as collision detector for geometrically highly complex solid objects in the application area of physically-based simulation.

 ADMM ⊇ Projective Dynamics: Fast Simulation of General Constitutive Models  ##   Rahul Narain, Matthew Overby, George E. Brown We apply the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) optimization algorithm to implicit time integration of elastic bodies, and show that the resulting method closely relates to the recently proposed projective dynamics algorithm. However, as ADMM is a general-purpose optimization algorithm applicable to a broad range of objective functions, it permits the use of nonlinear constitutive models and hard constraints while retaining the speed, parallelizability, and robustness of projective dynamics. We demonstrate these benefits on several examples that include cloth, collisions, and volumetric deformable bodies with nonlinear elasticity.
